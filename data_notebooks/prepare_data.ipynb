It doesn't provide the ability to configure multiple instances of itself and as such within Moodle you are only able to create a single APC cache store instance. Because of its incredible performance but very limited size it is strongly suggested that you map only small, crucial caches to the APC store.\\nAnother important thing to understand about the APC store is that it provides no garbage cleaning, or storage reclamation facilities. As such cache data will persist there until APC is restarted or the store is purged. On top of that once the store is full requests to store information within the cache fail until there is once more sufficient space. Because of this it is recommended that you regularly purge or restart APC. Also recommended is to map a secondary application cache instance to any definition with the APC mapped. This ensures that if it does indeed full up that an alternative cache is available.\\n\"},\n",

       "    'text': 'AsciiMathML has been massaged into quite a few formats,  and is presently available in a version 2.0.2 distribution from Sourceforge which can be quickly installed for Moodle as a javascripted based filter.\\nHowever, in exploring various features of AsciiMathML it was discovered that once installed (per the default instructions) the filter did not turn off (There is a Tracker item on this [need to add reference]. It is argued that this behavior may be due to artifacts in the usage of require_js ) and that there were issues with the filter not interacting appropriately with the Moodle quiz and message modules. It is possible that the filter may be made to behave more like a filter if the javascript files are moved and the php files edited to reflect their location.\\nFor the interim it was determined that asciimathml.js works very well if simply referenced in meta.php, and for those interested in using ASCIIMathML, it is suggested that a reference to it be placed in the appropriate theme and that a \"common\" location for the distribution files be identified ( see below )\\nAdditionally,  a php version of ASCIIMathML has been developed by Steve Chan.  Depending on usage, using the php version may or may not require the concurrent usage of an additional javascript file (arguably, if the web application displays XHTML, which Moodle does, the additional javascript file is not necessary.)\\nStemming from an initial joint project with Peter Jipsen, David Lippman has also maintained a version of ASCIIMathML.js that provides fallback to a TeX interpreter such as mimetex.  This can be important because ASCIIMathML requires that a) the browser used supports MathML (A W3C standard that Safari, for example does not support) and b) that adequate Math fonts are available to the browser (see note below about obtaining and installing fonts).\\nAs part of extending the fallback option to make ASCIIMathML usage more transparent for usage on Moodle, a Moodle version will be available.\\nThanks to David Lippman you can now parse ASCIIMathML for display using MathJax.  The configuration information can be found at http://www.mathjax.org/docs/2.0/options/asciimath2jax.html#configure-asciimath2jax . This implementation does not include ASCIISVG.\\nThe Super Equation Editor (See Advanced Math Tools) provides a variety of tools to manage display of ASCIIMathML\\nWARNING!!! With the development of separate docs for ech Moodle versin it is likely that much of this section WON\\'T work with Moodle 2,  though the same concept can be implemented in Moodle 2.\\nBecause of all the discussion regarding asciimathml and possible conflicts and fallback options please consider installing as follows pending the adoption of Moodle 2.0 and such integrations with tinyMCE as may be provided at that time.\\nFrom the SourceForge link above obtain the asciimath files. Place the asciimath folder in /lib so that you now have /lib/asciimath (the folder location has moved a bit over time, but I am recommending this change from placing the folder at /lib/editor/common/asciimath so as to be more consistent with other usage - Marc Grober 18:54, 1 July 2009 (UTC)) DO NOT place it with other filters in /lib/filter as it appears to continue to work whether it is turned on or not.  If you are interested in fallback, you may copy this file to the asciimath folder and, backing up your original asciimathml.js file, replace it with this one, changing the references inside it to you local mimetex or mathtran server.\\nNow edit your meta.php to point to the new location. You will have a meta.php in your theme\\'s directory and it will look something like the code below.... Note the inclusion of the two script stanzas. Just make sure the second points to the correct directory. <script type=\"text/javascript\">\\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"<?php echo $CFG->httpswwwroot\\xa0?>/lib/asciimath/ASCIIMathML.js\"></script> Now don\\'t forget to install the STIX fonts .\\n'},\n",

WHile it does this well, when it comes to the incremental features of either parsing and displaying tex text expressions,  or if using fallback,  converting asciimathml text expression to tex, there are occasions upon which the results of problematic.  Most often, this can be resolved through using an alternative text expression that parses to the same results,  and there is discussion in the Math Tools forum on such usage. Additionally, there is continuing research and effort in trying to provide a quick, easy, and seamless way to write and display math online.\\nWhile Firefox does do MathML, the results are problematic without appropriate fonts.  Initially the MIT fonts were recommended while Mozilla now recommends the STIX beta fonts.  There has been some continuing discussion on whether Firefox should bundle such fonts, but at present you will have to download and install fonts separately.  This is very easy to do and there are \"how to\"s to assist you.\\nDiscussion in the Assciimathml google group continues to yield \"fixes\" for specific font issues as possible, though some issues may reside in the browser.  We hope that by the time Moodle 2 is released with tinyMCE an asciimathml version with falabck that addresses most known font issues will be available here\\nDavid Lippman developed a fallback script (a version is offered above) that invokes mimetex or mathtran if for some reason the script determines that the current browser can\\'t display MathML.  Versions have been passed about that provide session cookies so that warnings are provided once, that do away with any warnings, etc. At some point a full set of versins with explanations may be available,  or perhaps a script with specific internal configuration instructions.

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is the key part of the W3C concerned with accessibility and usability.\\nThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG10), published May 1999, are the current recommendations that most apply to Moodle. There are useful documents including errata, a checklist, techniques , quick tips and so on . The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 are currently at the W3C Working Draft stage (17 May 2007) - they are expected to become a stable recommendation in 2008. WCAG20 is designed to be more testable and technology agnostic so that it can be applied to the full range of current and future technologies on the Web - XHTML, PDF, Flash and so on. HTML documents and sites that follow WCAG10 will almost certainly comply with WCAG20. (Key principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, robust POUR.) The Accessible Rich Internet Applications draft standards (ARIA roadmap September 2006) are useful to ensure that scripting and asynchronous events (AJAX) work with assistive technologies. They supplement HTML with additional semantics: role, state and properties. Moodle and components like the rich-text editor are subject to other guidelines including the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 , see this overview .\\n\\nWCAG 1.0 contains 14 guidelines (see below), sub-divided into 65 checkpoints numbered 1.1 to 14.3. The checkpoints are organised into 3 priority levels, 1 (A) must , 2 (double-A) should , 3 (triple-A) may - Moodle should aim for level 2 and some of level 3.\\n\\nProvide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content. Don't rely on color alone (or bold or other styling) Use markup and style sheets and do so properly. Clarify natural language usage Create tables that transform gracefully. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully. Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes. Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces. Design for device-independence. Use interim solutions. Use W3C technologies and guidelines. Provide context and orientation information. Provide clear navigation mechanisms. Ensure that documents are clear and simple.\\n\\n\"},\n",

There are several ways how translations can be staged, that is how translated strings can be put into the stage:\\nby using the AMOS translator by importing strings from an uploaded file by applying a previously created stash by applying a submitted contribution\\nLanguage pack maintainers have write access to the AMOS strings repository. Therefore, they can commit their stage permanently. Once the stage is committed, staged strings are stored in the AMOS repository. Every hour, AMOS generates ZIP packages from the most recent snapshot of the repository. These ZIP packages are published on the language pack download pages https://download.moodle.org/langpack/ . In addition, Moodle sites can install and update language packages automatically via Site administration > Language > Language packs .\\nCommunity members do not have write access to the repository so they can't commit their stage. Instead, they can submit it to the maintainers. By submitting a stage, a new contribution record is created and language pack maintainers are notified by automatic email message. Maintainers can review the submitted contribution and, if they accept it, commit it on behalf of the contributor.\\nThe stage can be also saved so you can interrupt your work and continue next time you come back to the site. The stage is saved into the so-called 'stashing area'. The stashing area consists of stashes. A new stash is simply a snapshot copy of your current stage. AMOS automatically keeps one stash for you as a backup copy of your most recent stage. A stash can be submitted to the maintainers too.\\n\"},\n",

You use that filter to get the strings you want to translate. When the filter settings are saved (2), a table with the filtered strings is displayed below.\\nEvery row in the table represents a single string. The table has four columns. The first column (3) describes the version (or branch) where the string is used, its identifier and its component. You can see a text like\\nThat reads: this string is used in Moodle 4.0, its identifier is \\'completiondate\\' and it belongs to \\'courserepor_completion\\' component.\\nThe second column (4) contains the English original of the string. Below the text, you can see Google icon. Click that icon to get automatic translation of the string into the language being translated. The next column contains a code of the language that this string is being translated to (for example \"cs\" for Czech).\\nFinally the last column contains the translation itself. If it is empty, the string is not translated yet, otherwise it displays the current translation. Click in the cell to turn it into the input editor. Insert the translation and click outside the cell to stage the translation. Note there is no submit button, the text is sent to the stage automatically in the background. You can see that the colour of the cell turned blue. Blue colour signalizes that the translation is currently staged.\\nYou have many options of how to use the strings filter. You can work on a single component or all missing strings at once. You can search for strings containing a given text (either in English or the translated string) etc. You can check for strings in older versions, too but those strings are read-only. They get automatically pulled into AMOS from the CVS repository of 1.x translations.\\nThe \\'permalink\\' below the filter\\'s submit button can be used to keep the current filter settings. For example, you can bookmark a setting use regularly or you can copy the link URL and send it to somebody so they can set their filter just by visiting that URL.\\nWhen you finish translating, do not forget to visit the stage page. You probably want either commit it (if you are a lang pack maintainer) or submit it to maintainers so they can review your work and include it into the language pack.\\nSadly, sometimes, AMOS may consider that your request-URI is too large to handle\\xa0:(\\n\\nStrings staged by a contributor\\nStrings staged by a contributor\\nStrings staged by a contributor\\n\\nThe translated strings are put into a temporary area called stage immediately after the cursor leaves the editor field. The stage holds your work before it is either committed into the repository (if you are language pack maintainer) or submitted to the maintainers for inclusion or stashed.\\nThe stage is cleared when you logout. You have to explicitly commit or stash the stage so it is saved permanently. If you forget to do it, or there is a problem with the connectivity, your browser crashes or whatever, you can find your most recent snapshot of the stage in autosave stash.\\nIf you are language pack maintainer, you can commit the stage into the repository so your work is registered and the translated strings become part of the official language package. You can also propagate the strings to other branches by selecting the branches you want the string to go to and hit the propagate button. It is a wise thing to do that, to save work and to keep consistency in the wording over the versions.\\nUpdated language packages in ZIP format are published hourly at https://download.moodle.org/langpack/4.0/ - look at the bottom of the page to see the last update. At the same time, they become available for Moodle sites for automatic update.\\nThe stage can also be used to import strings from files and to merge or compare versions of language packs.\\nEmpty stage allows you to import strings from a file\\nEmpty stage allows you to import strings from a file\\nEmpty stage allows you to import strings from a file\\n\\nStrings can be translated offline and uploaded back to AMOS using the stage page. The only supported format at the moment is common PHP format used by Moodle where strings are defined in associative array called $string. For obvious security reasons, AMOS can not actually execute PHP files uploaded by users. Instead, it parses the uploaded file in a similar way as PHP parser, looking for patterns that are considered as valid string definition. That means that not every valid PHP code is valid string definition. AMOS parser requires following conditions are met:\\nthe filename is valid component name used by Moodle, for example moodle.php, enrol_manual.php or workshop.php the file is valid PHP code without syntax errors - that means is passes the PHP lint check strings are defined as elements of global array $string strings are single quoted constants\\nExample of a valid file to import into AMOS (filename countries.php, Czech translation)\\nDuring the import, strings found in the file are added into your stage as if they were translated via web. You can commit them into repository if you have such privilege.\\nYou can import several .php files at once if you put them into a ZIP file (Maximum size: 2MB) and import this ZIP file.\\nAt any moment, you can save a snapshot of the current stage. We call such snapshot a stash . Stashed strings are kept forever until you drop them manually (please do not abuse this and keep your stashes reasonable big). To manage your stash, click on Stashes in the right menu of AMOS. You just see a list of the stashes. There are \"peekaboo\" buttons that appear when you mouse hoover over the stashes. The stash can be applied so that the stashed strings are copied back to the stage. What the pop does is apply and drop (delete) the stash. drop is like delete. submit to maintainer opens a form for doing just that.\\nThere is one special stash record for every user called autosave stash. This stash keeps the most recent state of the stage. You may find it useful if you loose the current stage for any reason - your browser crashes, your internet connectivity dies or you accidentally unstage all strings. If that happens, just apply the autosave stash to get your work back. The autosave stash is updated every time you stage a string. So if your stage is empty and your autosave stash is full of strings and you go into the translator first without applying the stash, the autosave will be replaced with the new translated string. We recommend to experiment a bit with this feature first.\\nThe Log page allows even anonymous users to search in the history of commits tracked by AMOS. At the top of the page there is a filter that allows you to look for a particular information or report. It is important to realize how the filter actually works. Searching and filtering happens in two steps (this was necessary for performance reasons):\\nFirstly, commit records are searched based on the criteria specified in the Commit filter form.

Contributors can submit the stage for maintainers. Stashes - are snapshots of the stage. Imagine them as ordinary files at your computer where you can save your work. You can submit your stash to the language pack maintainers. Contributions - is a database tracking all submitted contributions and their current status.

It holds translated strings temporarily during your current login session. If you log out, the stage is cleared (though there is a backup - see below). There are several ways how translations can be staged, that is how translated strings can be put into the stage:\\nby using the AMOS translator by importing strings from an uploaded file by applying a previously created stash by applying a submitted contribution\\nLanguage pack maintainers have write access to the AMOS strings repository. Therefore, they can commit their stage permanently. Once the stage is committed, staged strings are stored in the AMOS repository. Every hour, AMOS generates ZIP packages from the most recent snapshot of the repository. These ZIP packages are published on the language pack download pages https://download.moodle.org/langpack/ . In addition, Moodle sites can install and update language packages automatically via Site administration > Language > Language packs .\\nCommunity members do not have write access to the repository so they can't commit their stage. Instead, they can submit it to the maintainers. By submitting a stage, a new contribution record is created and language pack maintainers are notified by automatic email message. Maintainers can review the submitted contribution and, if they accept it, commit it on behalf of the contributor.\\nThe stage can be also saved so you can interrupt your work and continue next time you come back to the site. The stage is saved into the so-called 'stashing area'. The stashing area consists of stashes. A new stash is simply a snapshot copy of your current stage. AMOS automatically keeps one stash for you as a backup copy of your most recent stage. A stash can be submitted to the maintainers too.\\n\"},\n",

       "    'text': 'AMOS Translator tool\\nAMOS Translator tool\\nAMOS Translator tool\\n\\nThe translator tool page has two main parts. At the top, there is a filter form (1). You use that filter to get the strings you want to translate. When the filter settings are saved (2), a table with the filtered strings is displayed below.\\nEvery row in the table represents a single string. The table has four columns. The first column (3) describes the version (or branch) where the string is used, its identifier and its component. You can see a text like\\nThat reads: this string is used in Moodle 4.0, its identifier is \\'completiondate\\' and it belongs to \\'courserepor_completion\\' component.\\nThe second column (4) contains the English original of the string. Below the text, you can see Google icon. Click that icon to get automatic translation of the string into the language being translated. The next column contains a code of the language that this string is being translated to (for example \"cs\" for Czech).\\nFinally the last column contains the translation itself. If it is empty, the string is not translated yet, otherwise it displays the current translation. Click in the cell to turn it into the input editor. Insert the translation and click outside the cell to stage the translation. Note there is no submit button, the text is sent to the stage automatically in the background. You can see that the colour of the cell turned blue. Blue colour signalizes that the translation is currently staged.\\nYou have many options of how to use the strings filter. You can work on a single component or all missing strings at once. You can search for strings containing a given text (either in English or the translated string) etc. You can check for strings in older versions, too but those strings are read-only. They get automatically pulled into AMOS from the CVS repository of 1.x translations.\\nThe \\'permalink\\' below the filter\\'s submit button can be used to keep the current filter settings. For example, you can bookmark a setting use regularly or you can copy the link URL and send it to somebody so they can set their filter just by visiting that URL.\\nWhen you finish translating, do not forget to visit the stage page. You probably want either commit it (if you are a lang pack maintainer) or submit it to maintainers so they can review your work and include it into the language pack.\\nSadly, sometimes, AMOS may consider that your request-URI is too large to handle\\xa0:(\\n\\nStrings staged by a contributor\\nStrings staged by a contributor\\nStrings staged by a contributor\\n\\nThe translated strings are put into a temporary area called stage immediately after the cursor leaves the editor field. The stage holds your work before it is either committed into the repository (if you are language pack maintainer) or submitted to the maintainers for inclusion or stashed.\\nThe stage is cleared when you logout. You have to explicitly commit or stash the stage so it is saved permanently. If you forget to do it, or there is a problem with the connectivity, your browser crashes or whatever, you can find your most recent snapshot of the stage in autosave stash.\\nIf you are language pack maintainer, you can commit the stage into the repository so your work is registered and the translated strings become part of the official language package. You can also propagate the strings to other branches by selecting the branches you want the string to go to and hit the propagate button. It is a wise thing to do that, to save work and to keep consistency in the wording over the versions.\\nUpdated language packages in ZIP format are published hourly at https://download.moodle.org/langpack/4.0/ - look at the bottom of the page to see the last update. At the same time, they become available for Moodle sites for automatic update.\\nThe stage can also be used to import strings from files and to merge or compare versions of language packs.\\nEmpty stage allows you to import strings from a file\\nEmpty stage allows you to import strings from a file\\nEmpty stage allows you to import strings from a file\\n\\nStrings can be translated offline and uploaded back to AMOS using the stage page. The only supported format at the moment is common PHP format used by Moodle where strings are defined in associative array called $string. For obvious security reasons, AMOS can not actually execute PHP files uploaded by users. Instead, it parses the uploaded file in a similar way as PHP parser, looking for patterns that are considered as valid string definition. That means that not every valid PHP code is valid string definition. AMOS parser requires following conditions are met:\\nthe filename is valid component name used by Moodle, for example moodle.php, enrol_manual.php or workshop.php the file is valid PHP code without syntax errors - that means is passes the PHP lint check strings are defined as elements of global array $string strings are single quoted constants\\nExample of a valid file to import into AMOS (filename countries.php, Czech translation)\\nDuring the import, strings found in the file are added into your stage as if they were translated via web. You can commit them into repository if you have such privilege.\\nYou can import several .php files at once if you put them into a ZIP file (Maximum size: 2MB) and import this ZIP file.\\nAt any moment, you can save a snapshot of the current stage. We call such snapshot a stash . Stashed strings are kept forever until you drop them manually (please do not abuse this and keep your stashes reasonable big). To manage your stash, click on Stashes in the right menu of AMOS. You just see a list of the stashes. There are \"peekaboo\" buttons that appear when you mouse hoover over the stashes. The stash can be applied so that the stashed strings are copied back to the stage. What the pop does is apply and drop (delete) the stash. drop is like delete. submit to maintainer opens a form for doing just that.\\nThere is one special stash record for every user called autosave stash. This stash keeps the most recent state of the stage. You may find it useful if you loose the current stage for any reason - your browser crashes, your internet connectivity dies or you accidentally unstage all strings. If that happens, just apply the autosave stash to get your work back. The autosave stash is updated every time you stage a string. So if your stage is empty and your autosave stash is full of strings and you go into the translator first without applying the stash, the autosave will be replaced with the new translated string. We recommend to experiment a bit with this feature first.\\nThe Log page allows even anonymous users to search in the history of commits tracked by AMOS. At the top of the page there is a filter that allows you to look for a particular information or report. It is important to realize how the filter actually works. Searching and filtering happens in two steps (this was necessary for performance reasons):\\nFirstly, commit records are searched based on the criteria specified in the Commit filter form. If there are more commits found matching the filter settings, only 100 most recent commits are processed. Then, within the commits found, either all string modification records are returned, or you can filter these records, too. Settings in String filter form section are used in that case.\\nBy default, the filter looks for all commits since the last time you logged in and than displays only strings at the currently translated branch modified by those commits.\\nWhen a new Moodle version is released, it will become the default version on your Amos - Translator page (see tick boxes at the top).\\nThe suggested work flow is to continue your translation work for the new Moodle version and merge your work in the older versions.\\nSome time ago, people used to do that using the Amos - Stage page: Set the source version to the version you were working in and set the target version to the version you want the strings to be copied to.

A sort of cross between \"muse\" and \"doodle\".

Anyone who uses Moodle is a Moodler.\\nYou can try Moodle\\'s standard features on the Moodle Sandbox demo site , an empty out-of-the-box site. To explore Moodle in action on a site populated with courses, activities and users, visit the Mount Orange School demo site . You can obtain your own Moodle site on MoodleCloud .

A dedicated forum Teaching with Moodle exists to discuss different ways of using the many Activities and Resources of Moodle to enhance your teaching.\\nPeer assessment: see Workshop Discussion and debate: see Forum Sharing files and media: see Working with files Collaboration: see Glossary and Database Independent and personalised learning: see Lesson Submitting work online: see Assignments Assessment, summative and formative: see Quiz Gamification: see Gamification\\nTry the Mount Orange School demo , a working demonstration site full of examples for you to see and play with.\\nBy participating in many ways, either through events, Moodle Community Forums on Moodle.org and networks elsewhere. You can find and share courses and activities on our Moodle Community hub. You can download courses to use in your own site and publish course content to share with others. Within your own Moodle site, you can share courses with colleagues by using the Course import or Restore features .\\nYes. Moodle is used in a variety of fields . Users in some subject areas may benefit further from standard or compatible third-party modules and plugins:\\nIn maths , TeX notation filter (standard) or DragMath equation editor (third-party plugin)), and more than 10 third party question types. You can also use PhET simulations For language teachers , the contributed Hotpot and Poodll plugins are very popular. For chemistry there are many plugins for displaying molecular structures and making questions about them. You can also use PhET simulations For music there are question type plugins for key signature , music theory , music interval and musical scale . For computer programming there in an interactive assignment package and several question types.\\n'},\n",

No need to check the \\'view\\' condition if you have other requirements.\\nWhen this option is ticked, students have to get a grade on the activity in order to complete it. For example, a quiz would be marked completed as soon as the user submits it (so long as it doesn\\'t contain any \"essay\" questions).\\nIt does not matter how well the student did. Getting any grade will mark the activity completed.\\nA passing grade may be required for completion of a graded activity. This condition is used together with the Require grade requirement.\\nIt is possible to distinguish between \\'pass\\' and \\'fail\\' grades so that a quiz becomes \\'completed, passed\\' or \\'completed, not passed\\' instead of just \\'completed\\'. These results show a different icon and alternative text in the Activity completion report .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo set this up, you need to specify the pass value for the quiz activity\\'s individual grade:\\nGo to the Quiz settings and in the Grade section, locate the \\'Grade to pass\\' field.

If the quiz can be taken multiple times, the completion icon will automatically update whenever the grade does.\\nThere is one limitation: this only works if grades are immediately visible to students. The grade must be neither permanently hidden, nor hidden until a certain date. If a grade is hidden then only the standard \\'completed\\' state will be displayed - even once the hidden date has passed.\\nIf a grade to pass is set for the quiz then it will be marked complete once the student obtains this grade.\\nIf a certain number of attempts are allowed, the quiz may be marked complete once the student has done them all (even if, for example, they did not achieve the passing grade.)\\nNote that Require grade must be ticked as well as \"Require passing grade\".\\nQuizzes may be automatically marked complete when one or more attempts have been submitted. This can be helpful for example when manually graded questions are included but the teacher wants the quiz to be complete before these questions are graded.\\nThe following settings are specific to the Lesson activity (in addition to the standard ones)\\n\\nIn order for the lesson to be marked complete, the student must go to the very last page of the lesson.\\nIn order for the lesson to be marked complete, the student must stay within the lesson pages for the time specified by the teacher here.

Some of the reference here will overlap with the existing MoodleDoc page covering Conditional activities .\\nFor the purpose of this MoodleDoc article: AL is any code that allows the user to make decisions on the next available resource or item the student will be able to use based on student events or quiz performance. There is some activity locking code that is very quick and dirty to simply lock future activities and then there is much more complex code based on the conditional activity though structure which attempts to progress the student through the course in a thought out progression based on activities and performance.

Find the line \\'extension=php_ldap.dll\\' and take out the semi-colon if it is there. That semi-colon will stop it loading the module all together! \\nWhile you have that file open, search for \\'extension_dir\\' and note which folder it is set to. Open that folder and ensure the php_ldap.dll file is in there. If it isn\\'t then put it in there.\\nIf that still hasn\\'t fixed it you are missing a supporting dll, but you don\\'t get told that. To see what dlls are missing open the Command Prompt and navigate to the php directory and execute the following line \\'php -m\\'. You should get some error messages now. Ugly, but at least they give you information! Find the dlls listed and copy them to the php directory. You may now need to restart the apache/httpd service. Run \\'php -m\\' again and you should be error free and the message in Moodle should be gone now.\\nGetting this message when you are trying to log in is a result of incorrect details for the Bind user, or the user account having insufficient permissions in Active Directory. The best way to test and resolve this is use ldp.exe to test binding until it succeeds. There are instructions on installing ldp.exe below.\\nOpen the program and Connect to AD, giving the server name, then from the Connection menu choose Bind. Enter the details you think are correct and you will probably find that an error is returned. Try adjusting the accounts privileges or another account until you are returned an \"Authenticated as\" message.\\nOnce you are sure your account can be used to bind to AD, check that the DN of that users name is correct. Expand the tree on the left until you find the user you used to bind. Right click on that item and choose Copy DN. Go to the User Authentication page in Moodle and paste the value into the ldap_bind_dn field. Add the password and you can now feel safe your user is binding successfully.\\nFor those not familiar with AD this could be very confusing, and not that easy for some who are familiar with it. Again, ldp.exe is your friend. There are instructions on installing ldp.exe below.\\nOpen it up and expand the tree on the left until you find the group or user you want to use and right click on it and select Copy DN. Go back to the Moodle User Authentication page and paste that value into either ldap_contexts or ldap_creators.\\nBy default, Moodle uses an accounts cn (full name) to verify against, but most networks don\\'t use a full given name for logon as it\\'s too easy to guess and you can easily have two people with the same name. If this is the case for you too you need to tell Moodle to look at another field for the logon id.\\nIn ldp.exe navigate the tree on the left to find a user account, preferably your own. Double-click the item in the tree and full-details will be loaded into the screen on the right. Look down the details until you find your logon id and note the item listed against it. For me, and a lot of people, it is sAMAccountName. Copy this name and paste it into the ldap_user_attribute on the Moodle User Authentication page.\\nThere are instructions on installing ldp.exe below.\\nldp.exe comes as part of the Server Tools on most versions of Windows Server. Find your Windows Server installation disc and find a folder on it called Support\\\\Tools. In there will be a SupTools.msi which will install the server tools if run. You should now have a folder under Program Files called Support Tools, in which will be ldp.exe. ldp.exe is also available in the Windows XP Support Tools, which you can download from Microsoft here . Alternatively, a single download of ldp.exe is available here .\\nBelow is an example configuration for Active Directory. As detailed above, the values may vary based on your local Active Directory configuration, but should provide a good starting point for most cases.\\nNote that the ldap_bind_dn value should work in either the CN=bin-user,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com format as shown in the main instructions or the bind-user@example.com format shown in this example.\\n'},\n",
       "   {'header2_name': 'Global Catalogs',\n",
       "    'text': \"Moodle currently only has limited support for multiple domain controllers; specifically it expects each of the LDAP servers listed to contain identical sets of information. If you have users in multiple domains this presents an issue. One solution when working with MS-AD is to use the Global Catalog. The Global Catalog is designed to be a read-only, partial representation of an entire MS-AD forest, designed for searching the entire directory when the domain of the required object is not known.\\nThe Global Catalog is available on Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 Active Directory servers. To enable, open the ‘Active Directory Sites and Services’ MMC (Microsoft Management Console) snap-in. Extend ‘Sites’ and then the name of the Site containing the active directory forest you wish to use. Expand the server you wish to enable the Global Catalog on, right click ‘NTDS settings’ and select the ‘Properties’ tab. To enable, simply click the ‘Global Catalog’ checkbox. Under a Windows 2000 server it is necessary to restart the server (although it won't prompt you to); under Windows 2003 server it is not necessary to restart the server. In either case you will generally have to wait for the AD forest to replicate before the Global Catalog offers a representation of the entire AD forest. Changes made in Active Directory will also be subject to a short delay due to the latency involved with replication. If your AD servers are firewalled port 3268 will need to be opened for Global Catalog servers.\\nIf your organisation uses Microsoft Exchange then it its highly likely that at least one Domain Controller will already have Global Catalog enabled – Exchange 2000 and 2003 rely on the Global Catalog for address information, users also access the Global Catalog when using the GAL (Global Address List)\\n\\nIf your organisation has a main domain example.org, staff and students are contained in two child domains staff.example.org and students.example.org. The 3 domains (example.org, staff.example.org and students.example.org) each have a domain controller (dc01, dc02 and dc03 respectively.) Each domain controller contains a full, writable, representation of only the objects that belong to its domain. However, assuming that the Global Catalog has been enabled (see below) on one of the domain controllers (for example dc01) a query to the Global Catalog would reveal matching objects from all three domains. The Global Catalog is automatically maintained through replication across the active directory forest, it can also be enabled on multiple servers (if, for example, you need redundancy / load balancing.)\\nTo make use of this in Moodle to allow logins from multiple domains is simple. The Global Catalog runs on port 3268 as opposed to 389 for standard LDAP queries. As a result, still assuming the Global Catalog is running on dc01, the ' ldap_host_url' would be ldap://dc01.example.org:3268 . The rest of the settings are the same as for other MS-AS Auth setups.\\nYou should use the ' ldap_contexts' setting to indicate the locations of individuals you wish to grant access. To extend the example above a little: In the example.org domain users are all in the 'Users' OU, in the staff.example.org domain users are in two OUs at the root of the domain, 'Support Staff' and 'Teaching Staff' , and in the students.example.org domain students are in an OU indicating the year that they enrolled, all of which are under the 'Students' OU. As a result, our ' ldap_contexts' setting may look a little like this: 'OU=Users,DC=example,DC=org; OU=Support Staff,DC=staff,DC=example,DC=org; OU=Teaching Staff,DC=staff,DC=example,DC=org; OU=Students,DC=students,DC=example,DC=org .' The ' ldap_search_sub' option should be set to 'Yes' to allow moodle to search within the child OUs.\\nIts worth noting that the Global Catalog only contains a partial representation of the attributes of each object, as defined in the Partial Attribute Set supplied by Microsoft. However common information likely to be of use to a general Moodle installation (Forename, Surname, Email Address, sAMAccountName etc.) is included in the set. For specific needs the schema can be altered to remove or add various attributes - see Microsoft KB248717 for more information.\\nIn most cases the Global Catalog is read-only, update queries must be made over the standard LDAP ports to the domain controller that holds the object in question (in our example, updating a student's details would require an LDAP query to the students.example.org domain controller - dc03, it would not be possible to update details by querying the Global Catalog.) The exception to this would be in an environment where there is only a single domain in the active directory forest; in this case the Global Catalog holds a writable full set of attributes for each object in the domain. However, for the purposes of Moodle authorisation, there would be no need to use the Global Catalog in this case.\\nModifying the number of Active Directory objects to search:\\nBy default Active Directory only allows searches returning a limited number of objects per search. Since there is currently no Page control support in PHP 5.2.x which would enable smaller page searches you may need to modify your MaxPageSize setting to make sure LDAP Client searches can return enough user objects to support the number of authenticating users.\\nNote that starting with PHP version 5.4, PHP now supports page control. Newer versions of the LDAP configuration settings provide a value for page side. This value just needs to be set to a value less than the MaxPageSize of the Active Directory.\\nIf you find that the script is not running through all of your users properly and you have MS Active Directory + over 1000 users, follow the instructions here to set the MaxPageSize setting to a number higher than your total number of users (both now and in future) to fix it.  This is a forest-wide setting.\\n\"},\n",

Wherever it is used, it always refers to the same target resource. Relative URL - A URL that does not begin with \"http://\" is called a relative URL. It can be combined with the absolute URL of a \"base\" page, to get the absolute URL of the target resource.\\nRelative URLs are a convenient way to specify images, sounds and videos in a Hot Potatoes quiz, because they allow the quiz to be viewed and tested on a local PC, before being uploaded to a Moodle site. When the quiz is uploaded to the Moodle site, the multimedia files must also be uploaded, so that they are available when the quiz is administered via Moodle.\\nFor security reasons, Moodle does not allow direct access to course files. All requests for files in a given course go through a guardian script which verifies that the person requesting the file is enrolled in the course. However, this mechanism can break relative links used in the quiz, because the normal rules for deriving an absolute URL from a relative URL do not work.\\nThe solution is simple enough: all relative URLs must be converted to absolute URLs by the time the quiz reaches the browser. In the case of Hot Potatoes quizzes, the URLs will be converted by Moodle, so content creators do not have to bother with this tedious and error-prone task.\\n'},\n",

Check the box if you want these instructions to display on the course page.\\nThe available surveys have been chosen as being particularly useful for evaluating online learning environments that use a constructivist pedagogy. They are useful to identify certain trends that may be happening among your participants. (To see a paper where these are used in a detailed analysis, see: http://dougiamas.com/writing/herdsa2002 )\\nThis survey is based on a well-known survey from Stephen Brookfield.  By asking students to reflect on critical moments that they remember from the course you will (all) learn a lot about what is working and what is not.\\nThere are only 5 questions with free-text answers:\\nAt what moment in class were you most engaged as a learner? At what moment in class were you most distanced as a learner? What action from anyone in the forums did you find most affirming or helpful? What action from anyone in the forums did you find most puzzling or confusing? What event surprised you most?\\nThe COLLES comprises an economical 24 statements grouped into six scales, each of which helps us address a key question about the quality of the on-line learning environment:\\nRelevance \\tHow relevant is on-line learning to students' professional practices? Reflection \\tDoes on-line learning stimulate students' critical reflective thinking? Interactivity \\tTo what extent do students engage on-line in rich educative dialogue? Tutor Support \\tHow well do tutors enable students to participate in on-line learning? Peer Support \\tIs sensitive and encouraging support provided on-line by fellow students? Interpretation \\tDo students and tutors make good sense of each other's on-line communications?\\nUnderpinning the dynamic view of learning is a new theory of knowing: social constructivism, which portrays the learner as an active conceptualiser within a socially interactive learning environment. Social constructivism is an epistemology, or way of knowing, in which learners collaborate reflectively to co-construct new understandings, especially in the context of mutual inquiry grounded in their personal experience.\\nCentral to this collaboration is the development of students' communicative competence, that is, the ability to engage in open and critical discourse with both the teacher and peers. This discourse is characterised by an empathic orientation to constructing reciprocal understanding, and a critical attitude towards examining underlying assumptions.\\nThe COLLES has been designed to enable you to monitor the extent to which you are able to exploit the interactive capacity of the World Wide Web for engaging students in dynamic learning practices.\\n(This information has been adapted from the COLLES page. You can find out more about COLLES and the authors of it at: http://surveylearning.moodle.com/colles/ )\\nThe theory of 'ways of knowing', originally from the field of gender research (Belenky et al., 1986) provides us with a survey tool to examine the quality of discourse within a collaborative environment.\\nThe Attitudes Towards Thinking and Learning Survey (ATTLS) is an instrument developed by Galotti et al. (1999) to measure the extent to which a person is a 'connected knower' (CK) or a 'separate knower' (SK).\\nPeople with higher CK scores tend to find learning more enjoyable, and are often more cooperative, congenial and more willing to build on the ideas of others, while those with higher SK scores tend to take a more critical and argumentative stance to learning.\\nStudies have shown that these two learning styles are independent of each other (Galotti et al., 1999; Galotti et al., 2001). Additionally, they are only a reflection of learning attitudes, not learning capacities or intellectual power.\\nBelenky, M. F., Clinchy, B. M., Goldberger, N. R., & Tarule, J. M. (1986).

In situations where two group overrides may apply to a single user, the most lenient date is used. For \"Open the quiz\" dates, this means the earliest possible date is used, for \"Close the quiz\" dates, this means that the latest possible date is used. Note also that if there exists a user override for a student, it will always take precedence over any group overrides.\\nTo change a quiz setting for a particular group, click the \"add group override\" button in Quiz Administration > Group overrides , make the changes you wish and save or enter another override.\\nThis is very useful for schools where many students in many different groups wil have to answer the same quiz at different times and students have a tendency to share quiz passwords. You can set a different password and a different time frame for the quiz for each group and thus lower (a little) the risk of students cheating.\\n\\nNote: Students MUST be in the correct group for the group override to work as expected. If one student is not in the right group, or if the student is in two or more groups (e.g. the student is also in the group from the previous term), the student will not be able to use the override.\\n\\nTo change a quiz setting for a particular user or users, click the \"add user override\" button in Quiz Administration > User overrides , make the changes you wish and save or enter another override.\\nUser overrides are very useful when you need one exception (or a few) for an activity. For example, one student will have a doctor appointment the same day all the group must sit for a summative test; you decide to give the student a chance to take the test one day before all students. Only that particular student will be able to open the quiz that day, using a quiz password that is different from the password that will be used for all the other students the following day.\\n\\nNote: If the quiz is not accessible for the conditions set in an override, a warning message is displayed and the override becomes inactive.\\nFor example, consider a one-hour quiz that will be held on April 14, 2021, between 14:00 and 15:00. You want to set a 15-min extension for a student. In the quiz settings and under \"Timing\", you would set \"Open the quiz\" to 14 April 2021 14 00 and \"Close the quiz\" to 14 April 2021 15 00, as shown below. Also, in \"User overrides\", you would set an override for the student with \"Cloze the quiz\" set to 14 April 2021 15 15. It all works fine.\\n\\nHowever, in the quiz settings and under \"Restrict access\", if you have set \"Date\" restrictions so that the quiz can only be accessed \"from\" 14 April 2021, 14:00 and \"until\" 14 April 2021, 15:00, as shown below, a warning will be displayed when you set the override. See below.\\n\\n\\nThis message warns you that although you have extended the \"Cloze the quiz\" time to 15:15 for the student, the quiz will in fact be inaccessible for him after 15:00 due to the Restrictions in the quiz settings. The only way for the student to access the quiz after 15:00 is to remove the \"until\" date restriction in the quiz settings or change it to \"until\" 15:15. (Note that there seems to be a bug that if a \"from\" date restriction in the quiz settings is not specified, the warning message in the override is not displayed.)\\nYou should also consider other access restrictions, for example based on group or role assignments, and ensure that the quiz is not hidden.\\n'},\n",

If you plan to regularly export your questionnaire data to CSV, then you have a choice of two options for question naming.\\nIn the Question Name box, enter meaningful , short and different question names for all of the questions within one questionnaire.

This is required for table header fields in the CSV and subsequent Excel tables or any statistics package you might be using. The question name generated will be based on the question number in the actual Quiz (excluding Section Text pseudo-questions, of course) e.g. Q01, Q02, ... Q99. For questions with multiple answers, such as rate-type or Likert type questions, a sub-question number will be generated (Q02_1, Q02_2, Q02_3, etc.).

Of course, it\\'s up to you to have your own system for remembering which abbreviated question name corresponds to which question in your questionnaire!\\n5\\n6\\n7\\nQ07_1 Q07_2 Q07_3\\nIt is quite possible (but maybe not advisable) to mix the two systems, and have within one questionnaire both named and unnamed questions.\\nIf you need a question to be used as the \"parent\" of one or more subsequent questions in your questionnaire, then you must name that \"parent question\". Only those (radio buttons, dropdown list or yes/no) questions with a name will appear in the Parent question dropdown list when adding a new question, as shown on the following screenshots.\\n\\n\\nFor more information, see Conditional branching .\\nIf you select Yes , response to this question will be required, i.e. the respondent will not be able to submit the questionnaire until this question has been answered.

The format will depend upon the language currently being used by the questionnaire respondent. For example 4/21/2007 (US); 21/4/2007 (UK); 21-4-2007 (France); etc. An example will be displayed in the questionnaire. If an \"impossible\" or wrongly formatted date is entered, it will either be re-written or reformatted correctly (if possible) or an error message will be displayed to the respondent. In order for dates to be correctly exported to spreadsheets such as Excel, respondent must enter a date in the 1902 to 2037 range . If a date outside this range is expected from respondents, then use the Text Box question type instead. The date question type will accept dates consisting only of a month plus a year (e.g. 12/2008 for December 2008) or only a year (e.g. 2008). However, for spreadsheet processing compatibility, such incomplete dates will be automatically transformed to complete dd/mm/yy dates, e.g. 12/2008 -> 01/ 12/2008 and 2008 -> 01/01/ 2008. You may have to explain this pecularity to your questionnaire users beforehand.\\nThere is no real advantage to using the Dropdown Box over using the Radio Buttons except perhaps for longish lists of options, to save screen space.\\n\\nThis question will display a plain text box with x Textarea columns (or area width ) and y Textarea rows (number of text lines ).\\nIf you leave both x and y to their default 0 value (or if you set it to 0 ), then moodle\\'s HTML editor will be displayed with standard height and width (if available in the course/user context & user profile).\\nThis is not a question but a (short) text which will be displayed to introduce a series of questions.\\nUse this question type if you expect the response to be a correctly formatted number. By using the Max. digits allowed and Nb of decimal digits parameters you can specify the length and number of decimal places required. Use Max. digits allowed to set a limit to the number of characters entered for a Numeric question. Note that the decimal point also counts as one character!

Never Once a year Once a month Once a week Once a day\\nYou may enter “!other” on a line to create an optional fill in the blank option. An !other box defaults to using the prompt Other: , (or the equivalent translation for Other in the current language being used). You may change this default prompt by using the format: “!other= prompt text” as shown in Example #3 above.\\nNotes\\nAt the moment the length of the fill in the blank input text box is set to 25 characters and is not customizable through the online interface. It does not make sense to provide more than one !other fill in the blank option for a Radio Buttons question. If a respondent checks a fill in the blank option radio button and leaves the text field empty, a warning message will be displayed (upon navigating to the next page or upon submitting the questionnaire). If a respondent has checked a fill in the blank option radio button and has filled in the text field, and later on changes his mind and clicks a different radio button in the same question, the fill in the blank text field previously entered will be automatically emptied. Example #4 shows a possible \"hidden\" option, for exporting - in responses - named values as data instead of standard numbers. If you never export your data for studying it in stats packages you won\\'t need this option. If you plan to use the \\' \"Personality Test\"\\' feature in your questionnaire, the number preceding each choice will be used to calculate the \"score\" of the section that includes this question. See https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/mod/questionnaire/personality_test#Questions\\nThe Rate question now features extra \"not yet answered\" radio buttons. This is especially useful in Rate questions with a long list of choices.\\nIn case the respondent forgets to check some radio buttons, upon moving to next page or submitting, the error message will be completed with highlighting of the \"not yet answered\" radio buttons.\\n\\n\\nNb of scale items is the number of items to be used in your rate scale. You would normally use a value of 3 to 5. Default value: 5 .\\nNormal (default value) N/A columns : Choose this if you want an N/A column to be added to the right of your Rate scale items columns. No duplicate choices : Choose this if you want to prevent duplicate choices in each degree column . This is useful if you want the respondent to rank a number of items on a 1 to n scale and to force each rank to be unique. Example: order items A, B and C in order of preference will accept: A1, B3 and C2 or A3, B2 and C1 , but it will not be possible for the respondent to enter: A1, B1, C2 or A1, B2, C2, etc. Used in conjunction with named degrees , this No duplicate choices option can also be useful if you want the respondent to match items with named degrees, e.g. the colors red, blue, yellow with a set of physiological responses: excitement, tranquillity, concentration where one color can only match one physiological response. Osgood : Choose this to create a question of the Osgood\\'s semantic differential type. This parameter must be used in conjunction with named degrees .\\nThis is useful if you want the respondent to rank a number of items on a 1 to n scale and to force each rank to be unique.

On each line of \"Named degrees\" enter the degree number, immediately followed by the equal sign = immediately followed by the name you want to give to that degree.\\nIf you plan to use the \"Personality Test\" feature in your questionnaire, the number preceding each named degree will be used to calculate the \"score\" of the section that includes this question. See https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/mod/questionnaire/personality_test#Questions_2 .\\nIf the number of named degrees in the possible answers list is different from the number determined by the value you entered in the Nb of scale items field, this will be automatically adjusted when you save the question.\\nExample #3b shows a possible \"hidden\" option, for exporting - in responses - shorter label instead of the longer text values. If you never export your data for studying it in stats packages you won\\'t need this option. Please note that the example is provided here for the Rate with named degrees question sub-type but it works for all Rate question sub-types except Osgood which requires short left and right options anyway.\\nFor the Text Box question type, enter the Input Box length and the Maximum text length of text to be entered by respondent.\\nDefault values are 20 characters for the Input Box width and 25 characters for the maximum length of text entered.\\n'},\n",

The user \"Heraclito de Éfeso\" has editing capabilities in both courses, but as we can see in the following figure, the user \"Vasco da Gama\" cannot see the block about \"Disciplina de Demonstração\" since he is only teacher of the current course. A student could not see any of the blocks. \"Heraclito de Éfeso\" can in one place control both courses.

       "    'text': 'Here are some tricky issues that do not have a solid or obvious solution.  Please advise.\\nPage jumps determine the flow from one page to another and are a unique feature to Lesson.  So, how does one figure out all the necessary jump definitions needed for a question?  In Lesson, every answer has a jump, but this solution is not ideal.  A multiple choice question for example would have two cases:\\nSingle answer: a jump must be defined for each answer. Multiple answer : a jump would be defined for the correct answer and a jump for the wrong answer.\\nThe follow two sections discuss possible solutions, but please feel free to suggest others.  When thinking about this problem and perhaps a new solution, remember the primary goals of this project: reduce code size and simplify the Lesson code to make it easier to maintain.\\nAn invasive solution would be to modify the question class code.  This is invasive because the introduced code may only be used by Lesson unless it was implemented in such a way that it would be viable for other uses.  Some of the foreseeable changes would include the following:\\nAdd methods to the default_questiontype class that would handle the default behavior for defining jumps.  Default behavior would be two jump definitions: one for correct answers and one for incorrect answers. Provide a place to store the defined jumps. In each question type, override the default methods in the default_questiontype class to suite the behavior of the question (optional for each question type).\\nPros for this implementation:\\nAll question type code is in one place. Clean implementation Better work-flow for question authoring\\nCons:\\nPotentially introduce code that is unusable by other modules, etc.\\nLesson would extend all question types that to handle jumps.  Lesson would have its own type folder (mod/lesson/type).  This type folder would be organized the same as question/type directory.  Each question type would have its own folder and in that folder a questiontype.php .  So, mod/lesson/type/{questiontype}/questiontype.php where {questiontype} is replaced with each question type name. The questiontype.php would extend the original question type class and add the necessary methods for handling jumps.  The following methods would be added:\\nprint_jump_form: accepts the possible jump values from Lesson and then print (or return) the contents of a form.  This form would then be presented to the user to define the possible jumps. process_jump_form: accepts the form data from print_jump_form and organize it.  It then returns the organized data so that Lesson can store it. interpret_jump: accepts the user\\'s answer to the question and the returned value from process_jump_form .  This method would determine which jump Lesson should use. restore_jumps: restore the returned value from process_jump_form during Lesson\\'s restore routine.  Returns the restored value so that Lesson can store it.\\nExample use:\\nTwo jump definitions: correct or incorrect:\\nprint_jump_form would return the following form:\\nprocess_jump_form would accept the POST data from the above form and organize it in an array like this: array(\\'correct\\' => [lesson-jump-code], \\'wrong\\' => [lesson-jump-code]).  Where [lesson-jump-code] is a Lesson page id or jump code from the [drop-down-menu-with-lesson-jumps].  This array would be returned so that Lesson could store it. interpret_jump would accept the students answer and the above array.  It would return the [lesson-jump-code] either associated with correct or wrong based on the student\\'s answer. restore_jumps would be called during the Lesson restore process and it would return the restored array so that Lesson could store it.  Example: if each answer had a jump then the array would be defined like this: array(answerid => [lesson-jump-code] ... ).  The answerid would have to be mapped to the new answerid during the restore process.\\nPros for this implementation:\\nPotential Lesson specific code remains in Lesson.\\nCons:\\nWork-flow would have an extra step (create question then define jumps). Creating new question types is more difficult.\\nI (Tim) don\\'t like either of the above two solutions. I don\\'t like excessively lesson specific code in the question types, but it would be really bad if the code for a particular question type was not all in one place.\\nI think that the solution is to add a new concept: question outcomes. It will take me a couple of paragraphs to explain what I mean with this.\\nCurrently, after a student attempts a question, you get stuff that falls into two categories:\\ngeneric stuff, like the grade (both before and after applying the penalty factor), the penalty factor itself, the classification of the before grade as Correct/Partially Correct/Incorrect, a possible manual comment added by the teacher, the state of the question (saved, graded, manual graded, closed) question-type specific stuff, like the data in question_states->answer column, or the feedback that is displayed on-screen.\\nI think that in the generic stuff category, we need to add the new concept of \\'outcome\\'. This would be what the lesson module uses to select branches, and would probably also be useful to the quiz reports. It would categorise the student\\'s answer into one of a number of categories, and the question type class would need to implement two new methods:\\narray of strings all_outcomes($question)\\nstring outcome($question, $state)\\nFor multiple-choice (single response) this would return the answer selected. For shortanswer, numerical and calculated, this would return the answer that was matched. The generic implementation in the base class would probably have to just return \\'incorrect\\'/\\'partiallycorrect\\'/\\'correct\\' (that is the ids of the strings that are looked up in the language file.\\nThe lesson would then need to do branching be specifying where to go for each outcome. It would requre a multi-stage UI (create the question using the standard questionbank code, add the question to the lesson, link up the outcomes to jump targets). However, done well, this could be a very natural UI.\\nThe quiz UI is not perfect, but I think the way it is now: create a question, then add the question to the quiz, then adjust the grade for that question within the quiz, is very natural to use.\\n<comment>\\n</comment> - Mark Nielsen 23:42, 30 October 2006 (CST)\\n<comment>\\nI think you can use this without invasions. The questions contain feedback (which is a rought equivalent of outcome), and the answers with equivalent feedbacks are very likely to give equivalent jumps (if they still not, user can easily rewrite it using different words or just add some spaces or punctuation). You may not invade in the question types, but use feedback they return instead. You can use a table (apart from question editing interface) that allows author to specify jumps for feedbacks (or place jump right in feedback in some sort of you own tag - but it\\'ll restricts using one question on several pages or lessons with different jumps). This solution is quite easy to implement, probably an easier way than anyone mentioned there.\\nYou can get problem with some question types using this, but they are easily solved:\\nessay  - you probably will want to suppress using of manual graded question types in lessons anyway; multichoice in several choices mode - you can use correct/partial/incorrect feedbacks; match - it lacks feedbacks now, but probably it must have just correct/partial/incorrect as multichoice question, they are needed in it anyway, not only for the lessons.\\nYou may want to use feedback text only as values to communicate with user thought, replacing it in database by subquestion id or code for correct, partial or incorrect values. This allows you to avoid problems with editing feedbacks for existing questions.\\n</comment> -- Oleg Sychev 08:52, 13 November 2008 (CST)\\nby Mark Nielsen 13:43, 13 November 2006 (CST)\\nAfter a nice discussion with Michael Penney , a new solution to this problem arose.  Instead of working with the current method of each question having a set of defined jumps, instead introduce a new feature called state checker (the name at the moment, could change later).  These state checkers could be inserted throughout the lesson and are used to determine the navigation.  These state checkers could be set to say, if student has more than 70% correct then send the student to location X, otherwise send student to location Y. Alternatively, the state checker could be set to say if last question was correct, go to X otherwise go to Y .  These examples are binary, but the state checker , when fully implemented, should allow several more options and more granular control.\\nPros for this implementation:\\nNo major changes are required to the question bank code. Since the navigational control logic is separate from the question logic, one cannot accidentally modify or break a lesson\\'s navigation by editing a question. Lesson navigation can be controlled via one screen and is independent of questions . More possibilities for lesson navigation control. Could reduce the complexity of the multi-stage UI that the other solutions require.\\nCons:\\nMigration of old navigation structure could prove to be complicated depending on how the state checker would be developed (NOTE: this is already a problem.  See next section Migration of jumps ).\\n<comment>\\n</comment> - Mark Nielsen 16:17, 24 March 2007 (CDT)\\nRegardless of implementation, one problem remains: if each question potentially does not have a jump defined for each answer, then how are the currently defined jumps supposed to be migrated to the new question implementation (remember, Lesson questions have one jump defined for each answer regardless if it makes sense at all)?  The only solution that comes to mind is to have strict definitions for migration for the following question types that exist in Lesson :\\nMultichoice (single and multianswer) Matching Numerical Short Answer True/False Essay\\nNote: the use of migration here refers to upgrading old Lessons and restoring older Lessons.\\nI think the adaptive jumps of Lesson are a key feature.  If I read the above correctly, I don\\'t like limiting this to either a correct answer jump or a wrong answer jump.  I do like the concept of a jump form.   -- Chris collman 09:49, 8 November 2008 (CST)\\nThis also begs the special navigation features used in clusters and \\'branches\" with end of Branch which Mark has addressed with Check Points which I assume are different that State Checkers.I know nothing about elegance, and that is why I like to write about what developers have created\\xa0:)-- Chris collman 09:49, 8 November 2008 (CST)\\nOnce a solution for the above problem has been found, I would like to discuss the possibility of replacing the functionality of branch tables with the description question type .  Reason for discussing this after a solution has been found is because the solution may influence the outcome to this problem.\\n'},\n",

This setting only affects what happens if the student starts a timed attempt, then leaves the attempt, and then later time expires.\\nThere are three options as to what will happen when the time limit is up. Choose the one you need from the dropdown menu:\\nOpen attempts are submitted automatically (This is the default) There is a grace period when open attempts can be submitted, but no more questions answered Attempts must be submitted before time expires, or they are not counted.\\nIf you select \" There is a grace period... \" then you can check the box to enable the \"Submission grace period\" and specify a period of time during which learners may still submit the quiz after the time is up.\\nNote: You can change quiz availability and duration for different groups or users in the Group or User override sections in quiz administration.\\n\\nA student starts a quiz at noon. The quiz has a one-hour time-limit, and a 1-hour delay between attempts. The student gets distracted, and so actually does not submit (using the overdue handling) until 1:30pm. They are allowed to start their second attempt at 2. pm The quiz count-down timer submits a student\\'s quiz attempt at the last second when time expires. Because the server is heavily loaded, it takes 30 seconds to process the student\\'s attempt. The submission is accepted nonetheless. Same situation as above but with a 120-second delay: The submission is rejected. The delay is not because of server load but because the student found a way to cheat the timer. Moodle cannot know what causes a delay. The behaviour is controlled by the admin setting (quiz | graceperiodmin), 60 seconds by default. A student is a member of 3 groups, all of which have different override settings. Which limits will apply to this student? If there is any user-specific override, then that is used, and the group overrides for that setting are not used at all. Otherwise, if there are multiple group overrides, the most generous values are used (the earliest open date, the latest close date, the longest time limit, the most number of attempts, and the student can type any of the passwords).\\n'},\n",

You can set a different password and a different time frame for the quiz for each group and thus lower (a little) the risk of students cheating.\\n\\nNote: Students MUST be in the correct group for the group override to work as expected. If one student is not in the right group, or if the student is in two or more groups (e.g. the student is also in the group from the previous term), the student will not be able to use the override.\\n\\nTo change a quiz setting for a particular user or users, click the \"add user override\" button in Quiz Administration > User overrides , make the changes you wish and save or enter another override.\\nUser overrides are very useful when you need one exception (or a few) for an activity. For example, one student will have a doctor appointment the same day all the group must sit for a summative test; you decide to give the student a chance to take the test one day before all students. Only that particular student will be able to open the quiz that day, using a quiz password that is different from the password that will be used for all the other students the following day.\\n\\nNote: If the quiz is not accessible for the conditions set in an override, a warning message is displayed and the override becomes inactive.\\nFor example, consider a one-hour quiz that will be held on April 14, 2021, between 14:00 and 15:00. You want to set a 15-min extension for a student. In the quiz settings and under \"Timing\", you would set \"Open the quiz\" to 14 April 2021 14 00 and \"Close the quiz\" to 14 April 2021 15 00, as shown below. Also, in \"User overrides\", you would set an override for the student with \"Cloze the quiz\" set to 14 April 2021 15 15. It all works fine.\\n\\nHowever, in the quiz settings and under \"Restrict access\", if you have set \"Date\" restrictions so that the quiz can only be accessed \"from\" 14 April 2021, 14:00 and \"until\" 14 April 2021, 15:00, as shown below, a warning will be displayed when you set the override. See below.\\n\\n\\nThis message warns you that although you have extended the \"Cloze the quiz\" time to 15:15 for the student, the quiz will in fact be inaccessible for him after 15:00 due to the Restrictions in the quiz settings. The only way for the student to access the quiz after 15:00 is to remove the \"until\" date restriction in the quiz settings or change it to \"until\" 15:15. (Note that there seems to be a bug that if a \"from\" date restriction in the quiz settings is not specified, the warning message in the override is not displayed.)\\nYou should also consider other access restrictions, for example based on group or role assignments, and ensure that the quiz is not hidden.\\n'},\n",

This strategy uses a couple of assertions and assessors just need to check if the given assertion is passed or failed. That is, they only need to choose ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for each criterion in the assessment form. In this case, there are three assessors, Alice, Bob and Cindy. And the assessment form contains three criteria. The author will get 100% grade if all the criteria are passed, 75% if two criteria are passed, 25% if only one criterion is passed and 0% if the assessor gives ‘no’ for all three assertions. Here are the assessments they give to one certain work:\\nAlice: yes/yes/no Bob: yes/yes/no Cindy: no/yes/yes\\nThen the best assessment will be: Yes/yes/no\\nSecond, the workshop will give the best assessment 100% grade. Next it will measure the ‘distance’ from other assessments to this best assessment. The farther the distance, the lower grade the assessment will receive.

In the example above, all of the three assessors give 75% to the submission. However, only Alice and Bob will get 100% grade for their assessments, while Cindy will get a lower grade. Because Alice and Bob agree in individual responses too, while the responses in Cindy’s assessment are different.\\nComparison of assessments:\\nThis setting has 5 options: very lax , lax , fair , strict and very strict . It specifies how strict the comparison of assessment should be. By using comparison with the best assessment method, all assessments will be compared with the best assessment picked up by workshop.

You normally won\\'t need this unless you find you are getting spammed a lot.\\nTo use this question type you need to get a key from Google reCAPTCHA .\\nThis allows you to choose to display the course and/ or the category where the feedback is located.\\nLike a standard Moodle label, this allows you to add arbitrary text between questions allowing for extra explanation or to divide the Feedback into sections.\\nThis option is for creating a text box (you specify how big it will appear in rows and columns) which people can write a long answer into.\\nSelecting this then offers you three alternatives:\\n(1) Multiple choice single answer. This will give you a series of radio buttons, which starts on \\'Not selected\\' and then has your options afterwards. Only one can be chosen and \\'Not selected\\' is a valid answer if the question is not set to \\'required\\'.\\n(2) Multiple choice, multiple answers\\n(3) Multiple choice - single answer allowed (dropdown list)  This type will give you a dropdown list from which only one answer can be selected.\\nThis is similar to the Multiple Choice question type, except that each option has a numerical value associated with it. You have the choice of using radio buttons or a drop-down list to display the answers.\\nSay you have the following question:\\nI love it I like it It\\'s OK I don\\'t like it I hate it\\nIt isn\\'t possible to compute an \"average\" score from the responses chosen by multiple participants.\\nIf the Multiple Choice (Rated) question type is used, numerical values are associated with each answer, allowing an average or other measurements to be computed for the responses.\\nWhen listing the different answers to your question, you need to prepend each answer with a number followed by a forward slash (/) . That number will be the value associated with that answer. For our example from above, we could enter the following lines into the \"Multiple choice values\" field of the question:\\n5/ I love it 4/ I like it 3/ It\\'s OK 2/ I don\\'t like it 1/ I hate it\\nThe question will then be displayed like this:\\n(5) I love it (4) I like it (3) It\\'s OK (2) I don\\'t like it (1) I hate it\\nThis would allow for an average (e.g. \"4.5 this term, up from 3.9 last term\") to be calculated.\\nHere, you ask a question which must have a number as an answer and specify the acceptable range e.g. \"How many arms would you like, if more than 2 were possible? (please specify 0-10)\" with a range of 0-10 set in the options. It helps if you specify the acceptable range in the question text.\\nThis option lets you specify a single line answer, with an input box which is a set number of characters long (you choose). You also specify the maximum number of characters you will accept, so that the answer is not too long and/or does not run over the length of the box on screen.\\n'},\n",

Even those who are very comfortable working directly online might find it useful to note down on paper the direction they want their lesson pages to go in, rather than having to remember  and visualize the navigation in their head.

For general information about these question types, see Import questions .\\nA cluster is a group of question pages which will be offered randomly to a student as they work through the lesson. It is best if you have made the question pages beforehand and can then decide where to mark the start and end of the cluster. The start is marked by a \"cluster\" page and the end by an \"end of cluster\" page. See Clusters for more information.\\nThis is a page where a teacher can provide information to move the lesson forward but without requiring the student to answer specific questions. The student sees the page\\'s title, some information and then one or more buttons at the bottom to select. When the student clicks on a button, they go to the next page but their choice is not scored.\\nThe title of a content page appears to the student at the top of the page. A teacher will also see the title in the collapsed edit mode when they are working on the Lesson, and they will also be able to choose the title (and hence this page) from the drop down \"jump\" lists. The title in a content page is also used with the \"display left menu\" setting.\\nThis is where the teacher can add information for the student, making use of the Text editor and its multimedia features.\\nHere the teacher writes the words they want the student to click on to get to the next part of the lesson. These words will appear to the student as a button. The teacher can check the box to have the buttons appear horizontally, or uncheck it for them to appear centered vertically.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow many of these you have depends on your choice in  the Maximum Number of Answers setting in Lesson settings\\nEach Description in a Content page has a Jumps menu. \"Jumps\" take a student from one page to another. A \"relative jump\" is \"next page\" or \"end of lesson\" whereas an \"absolute jump\" gives the actual name of a page. The teacher chooses from the dropdown the correct page to send the student to if they click on the button that will be made from this particular description. Any pages created by the teacher will have their titles appear in this dropdown, allowing them to be selected. When a student clicks on a description button, they are sent to the page defined in the Jump associated with the button. See Jumps for more detailed information.\\nFrom this link you can choose from a variety of question types which will then be added as pages to your lesson: (Note: These question types are not the same as the Quiz Question types and are in no way connected with quiz questions.) The format of question pages is similar to content pages outlined in Section 2.4 above. A typical question page could include: Title - the name the student sees at the top of the question page.

The answer list will be shuffled every time the question is view by a student. By default they choose one answer but you can check the box \"multiple answer\" to allow them to choose more than one answer.\\nThe file picker is available in the editor so that images and other media may be uploaded as part of the answers and responses.\\nStudents can write a longer answer as part of the lesson and this can be graded manually by the teacher. Students and teachers can add files such as images and can record audio and video when submitting or grading essays.\\nSee Using Lesson for more information on grading essays. If the main purpose of your lesson is for students to write an essay, consider the Assignment module instead.\\nNote: Non-editing teachers may also grade lesson essay questions, even though they cannot edit the lesson itself.\\nThis allows you to set up lists which must be matched against other lists, for instance, words, pictures, numbers etc. The student must match all correctly to receive the score.\\nThis requires a number as an answer. A number within a range may also be accepted as correct. The range separator to be used is the colon\\xa0: For example, to accept as correct any number between 10 and 12 (10, 11 and 12) you would type 10:12 in the answer box. Only the plain text editor is available in the answer box.\\nA student must provide a single word or short phrase answer. The teacher must anticipate the possible answers and enter them  in the answer box, using ** wild cards if appropriate. Only the plain text editor is available in the answer box.\\nYou can include 5 or more underscores in the question text and these will be replaced for the student by the answer box.

If you need them, you will pick these skills up as you go, and if you already have any programming skills, it is going to be fairly easy to do so. If you have never done any programming before, it is a little more difficult, but once you have the idea, it becomes a lot easier. Unless you intend on developing your Moodle, e.g. build your own home made theme, alter code to reflect your own organization, then you can get away without any of these skills. What you need is a way of developing a quick understanding of how Moodle works. With the introduction of Moodle v2, the learning curve has steepened somewhat, but it is still not that difficult.\\nInstalling and setting up a new Moodle is not as difficult as it used to be. Some servers and service providers do have problems, from time to time, but if you work with your ISP, and the Moodle Community, you will get your Moodle up and running.

This does not mean the plugins are badly written, and some are really handy, just sometimes things go wrong. If you are going to use them, be deliberate in your choice, do not use them just because it might be a good idea.\\nPerhaps the best thing is that you create a Moodle on your desktop, or laptop, and you use that as a testbed. It should be the same version as your production site, to make things easy. Try things there first, if there is no problems, then you can replicate it on your production site.\\n'},\n",

       "    'text': 'See the Moodle version information on the Site Administration > Notifications page.\\nFirst, try using the Forgotten password link (if you have one on your site.) If you don\\'t know the admin username, often it is simply \\'admin\\'.\\nCli tool: You can reset the admin user\\'s password using the command line tool reset_password.php provided with Moodle.\\nConfig.php setting: You can also set any user to be an admin user using the setting in the config.php file for this: $CFG->siteadmins=\"2,#\"; where # is the id number of some user you do know the password to. This will turn that user into an administrator. See the details in the config-dist.php file on how to use this.\\nIf you do not have command line access, but do have access to the database, you can modify a password there. Passwords for all users, including admin, are stored as cryptographic hashes in the table mdl_user . You can manually replace the old hash with md5 value of the new password, it will be upgraded to the strong hash value after the first log-in.\\nOr, you can also do the equivalent of the config.php siteadmins setting by adding a user id number of a user with a known password to the mdl_config table where the \\'name\\' equals \"siteadmins\". (This may be row 23 in the table, since it is built during install.) The \\'value\\' is a comma delimited list of the id numbers of admin users. The default value is 2, for the main predefined admin. Add any other admins here, comma separated. For example, if you want to add user 3 as an admin, edit the value and put 2,3 as the value. You may need to flush caches for this to take effect right away, since lots of user info is cached.\\nUse one or the other of the two methods for Maintenance mode to do this.\\nSometimes Moodle gets stuck in maintenance mode and you\\'ll see the message \"This site is undergoing maintenance and is currently unavailable\" despite your attempts to turn-off maintenance mode.\\nWhen you put Moodle into maintenance mode it creates a file called maintenance.html in moodledata/maintenance.html (the site files folder). To fix this try the following:\\nCheck that the web server user has write permissions to the moodledata folder. Manually delete the maintenance.html file.\\nThe base URL of your site is set in the config.php file setting wwwroot. All dynamic links (e.g. course and activity URLs) are built by prefixing this setting on the fly. These are known as \"relative links.\"\\nYour Moodle site may also contain \"absolute links\" to resources which point to the previous URL, if you or anyone has copy/pasted the links into activities like Pages, or other locations in Moodle. These are text strings just like any text or link to a web site.\\nTo change such absolute in bulk, Moodle contains a utility called Search and replace to change all the links to the new URL. To change this login as admin and enter http://yoursite.com/admin/tool/replace/index.php in your browser address bar. Fill in your old base url and new base in the boxes and run the utility.\\nIf you change the domain name of your site, there may be work you need to do on your web server and/or DNS settings as well to configure it to understand the new domain. See Migration for more tips.\\n\\nThe most likely cause is that the mdl_log table has become corrupted. See the How to check your database for corruption . NOTE: A new logging system has been i place since Moodle 2.7 as an option. Be sure to check in Site administration > Plugins > Logging > Manage log stores to see whether you are still using the old style logging, Legacy log, or the Standard log.\\nTypically, you might see an error message like \\'./moodle/mdl_quiz_grades\\' is marked as crashed and should be repaired. See How to check your database for corruption for the solution.\\nThis is controlled by your language pack and default language. In this case, you are probably using the default Moodle language pack \\'en\\' which is common (and sometimes specifically Australian) spellings. If you need American English, add the en_us language pack and set it as the default.\\n'},\n",

Not very likely these days (i.e. check if the other settings don\\'t work), there is a setting in Apache 2 which you may need to change. You can change the limit by adding or editing a line in Apache\\'s /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf with the upload size in bytes (check your operating system\\'s documentation for the correct location - e.g. under /etc/apache2 is a common alternative):\\n2. PHP also has limits. If you have access to it they are set in your site-wide php.ini file. On shared hosting you may be able to set these in a .htaccess file or a php.ini . You are recommended to check with your hosting company how this works on their systems.\\nIn a php.ini file the lines will look something like:\\n...in .htaccess the entries will look like this:\\n\\nAn .htaccess file usually can be placed in the root of your Moodle install and will affect the whole Moodle. A (non site-wide) php.ini file may need to be copied into all the directories it needs to affect. The following are a good start:\\nPlease note that a server restart may be required for the above changes to take effect.\\n3. Moodle has a site-wide limit called maxbytes that may be set in Site Administration > Security > Site security settings > Maximum uploaded file size . The default here is (site limit) which it reads from the php.ini files You can set this lower if you wish for Moodle itself but don\\'t set it lower than the largest possible file you will be uploading\\nTo find out the server limit setting in php.ini (without server access, just using the Moodle administration interface), see Site Administration > Server > PHP info (Tip: search for filesize)\\n4. You should usually set the default for all newly created courses to something lower than the site limit. This is set in Site administration > Courses > Course default settings > Maximum upload size . Inside each course, this then may be individually set or changed for that course as needed by the usual teacher role in Course settings .\\n5. Activity modules that can be set to allow students to upload files to them, such as Forums and Assignments , have their own limits which may be set when adding or editing the activity.\\nSee also\\nUsing Moodle Detailed instructions to increase the maximum allowed size for uploaded files forum discussion Using Moodle Instructions to increase maximum allowed size on hosted servers forum discussion File Upload Size page Instructions below on How to change the maximum execution time\\nIn a localhost (using a Complete install packages for Windows on a computer)  it is easy to change the uploaded file size to something larger than the default 16M.\\nHere is an example of how to change the upload file size to 100M.\\nFind .. /php/php.ini and open it with WordPad by right-clicking -> Open With -> then choose WordPad. In this file scroll or do a search on the text \"_max_\" to find upload_max_filesize = 16M Change that line to\\nIn the same way, find post_max_size = 16M Change that line to\\nSave the file.\\nAfter any changes to the php.ini file you need to restart Apache. So restart xampp and browse to localhost. You should find that the Upload file size in Configuration now reads 100M.\\nSee also\\nInstructions below on How to change the maximum execution time\\nA side-effect of increasing the file upload limit is that the php scripts may execute beyond the limit set by default (300 seconds/5 minutes). To change this, look for max_execution_time in php.ini and change to something like this:\\nIf you are using Apache and have a .htaccess file to change php settings, add this line to your .htaccess file:\\nRestart your webserver for these changes to take effect, and check that the values have been changed by looking at your phpinfo output in the moodle admin -> environment page.\\n'},\n",

Try the following:\\nYou are an admin and the courses you are looking at have work, but you are not enrolled as a teacher in them. This is to prevent site admins from seeing thousands upon thousands of items unnecessarily. Adding yourself as a teacher in a category will work for the courses within it, but not at site level. You have your course or activity set to 'separate groups' and you are not in the same groups as the students whose work you can't see. Many people use this technique to hide classes from teachers who don't teach them, so I've set the block up to respect this. Join all the groups in the course and you should be fine. You have used the AJAX Marking Block's configuration tab to set some items to 'hide' or set some groups to 'hide'. To reset the settings, you can either run an SQL query like this: DELETE FROM mdl_block_ajax_marking where userid = <youruserid> or, you can check the config tab and set all the course level things to hide and back again. This will work because changing the course level settings destroys all the overrides at activity level. Don't forget to do the same with any groups. The work you are looking for is from a module that is not supported (yet).

For instance 2*x and x+x are considered as identical.\\nThis method requires the external, open source Sage symbolic algebra system to be installed on a server. A simple XMLRPC server script in Python is included in the package, sage_server.py, and this provides a method to symbolically compare two expressions.\\nFrom a theorical point of view this method is surely the best one. But it\\'s also the uneasiest one because it require an external server and depending on the way your Moodle server is hosted this may or may not be possible.\\nIf you absolutely need that sort of mathematic question and answer verification, it is suggested that you look at a more modern, more secure and more powerful question type, the STACK question type\\nThis uses the internal PHP algebra parser included in the parser to compare the two expressions. It was intended for use in \"expand...\" and \"factor...\" type questions where a full symbollic comparison would allow the student to enter the unexpanded (or unfactorized) expression.\\nThe usage of this comparison method has received few testing and no users of the Moodle Quiz forum reported using it. So it is suggested to be very cautious if you plan to use it on a production server.\\nAs a general rule it is recommended that you stick with the Evaluation comparison method unless very special need and that you know what you are doing.\\n'},\n",

Moodle core includes 2 prediction processors:\\nThe PHP processor is the default. There are no other system requirements to use this processor.\\nThe Python processor is more powerful and it generates graphs that explain the model performance . It requires setting up extra tools: Python itself ( https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download ) and the moodlemlbackend python package. The package can be installed in the web server (in all the nodes if in a clustered environment) or in a separate server.\\nMoodle 4.0 and up uses package 3.0.* (minimum 3.0.4)\\nThe latest version of the packages for Moodle 3.8 and up are compatible with Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 . Note that the package should be available for both the Command Line Interface (CLI) user and the user who runs the web server (e.g. www-data).\\nIf necessary, install Python 3 (and pip for Python 3) Ensure that you use Python 3 to install the moodlemlbackend package (for VERSION, see the previous section):\\nYou must also enter the path to the Python 3 executable in Site administration -> Server -> System paths:\\nEnter system path for Python 3\\nEnter system path for Python 3\\nEnter system path for Python 3\\nEnter system path for Python 3\\nTo install the python package in a separate server instead of installing it on the web server/s have some advantages:\\nKeeps the python ML backend as an external service To keep a separated control of the resources the web server/s dedicate to serving Moodle and the resources dedicated to the python ML backend You can reuse the same ML server for multiple Moodle sites. Easier to setup and maintain than to install/upgrade the python package in all nodes in the cluster You can install the package as a new docker container in your dockerized environment You can serve the ML backend from AWS through the API gateway and AWS lambda, storing the trained model files in S3\\nOn the other hand, it is expected that there can be some added latency in connecting to the python ML backend server.\\nThe python backend is exposed as a Flask application. The Flask application is part of the official \\'moodlemlbackend\\' Python package and its FLASK_APP script is \\'webapp\\', in the root of the package. You are free to use the setup that better suits your existing infrastructure.\\nThe python ML backend is exposed as a Flask application, which uses a WSGI server ( https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html ) to be exposed to the www. The official documentation on how to deploy a Flask app can be found in https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/tutorial/deploy/ .\\nUse MOODLE_MLBACKEND_PYTHON_USERS environment var to set a list of users and password (comma-separated).

We use it internally at Moodle HQ for internal testing and you can use it as well. You may want more control over the image, if that is the case https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker-mlbackend-python/blob/master/Dockerfile can serve as an example of what is needed to get the python moodlemlbackend package working.\\nUse MOODLE_MLBACKEND_PYTHON_USERS environment var to set a list of users and passwords (comma-separated). The value is \\'default:sshhhh\\' (user: default, password: sshhhh).\\nTo run the docker container locally you can execute (For VERSION , see the Versions section above):\\ndocker pull moodlehq/moodle-mlbackend-python:VERSION-python3.7.5\\ndocker run -d -p 5000 :5000 --name = mlbackendpython --rm --add-host = mlbackendpython:0.0.0.0 moodlehq/moodle-mlbackend-python:VERSION-python3.7.5\\nNote that you need to add --network=moodledocker_default if your are using moodle-docker and you want this container to be visible from the web server.\\nThen add this to your config.php file:\\n$CFG -> pathtopython = \\'python\\' ; define ( \\'TEST_MLBACKEND_PYTHON_HOST\\' , \\'localhost\\' ); // Change to \"mlbackendpython\" if your are using moodle-docker. define ( \\'TEST_MLBACKEND_PYTHON_PORT\\' , 5000 ); define ( \\'TEST_MLBACKEND_PYTHON_USERNAME\\' , \\'default\\' ); define ( \\'TEST_MLBACKEND_PYTHON_PASSWORD\\' , \\'sshhhh\\' );\\nTo check if it works, this command should not Skip any test:\\nvendor/bin/phpunit analytics/tests/prediction_test.php --verbose\\nYou can serve the Flask application as a serverless application using the AWS API gateway and AWS lambda. The easiest way to do it is using Zappa https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa to deploy the Flask application contained in the python ML package.\\nUse MOODLE_MLBACKEND_PYTHON_USERS environment var to set a list of users and password (comma-separated).

If for some reason you also have data in the older “legacy logs,” you can enable the Moodle Learning Analytics system to access them instead.\\nAnalysis intervals determine how often insights will be generated, and how much information to use for each calculation. Using proportional analysis intervals allows courses of different lengths to be used to train a single model.\\nSeveral analysis intervals are available for models in the system. In this setting, the analysis intervals that will be used to evaluate models are defined, e.g. so the best analysis interval identified by the evaluation process can be selected for the model. This setting does not restrict the analysis intervals that can be used for specific models.\\nAnalysis intervals\\nAnalysis intervals\\nAnalysis intervals\\nAnalysis intervals\\nEach analysis interval divides the course duration into segments. At the end of each defined segment, the predictions engine will run and generate insights.

This directory can be used by machine learning backends to store trained algorithms (its internal variables weights and stuff like that) to use them later to get predictions.

PostgreSQL uses a client authentication file called \\'pg_hba.conf\\' in PostgreSQL\\'s \\'data\\' folder. In this file, you\\'ll find a list of which users are allowed to connect to which databases, the IP addresses they are allowed to connect from, and the authentication methods they can use to connect.\\nIn the client authentication file, you\\'ll find the following line (starting with a \\'#\\' sign), which tells you the order to add each piece of data. To grant permission for Moodle to connect to a PostgreSQL server on the same machine, just add the following line, changing the DATABASE and USER columns to your actual database name and the username you set up above. The METHOD field should say \"password\" - don\\'t put your actual password here.\\nIf your database lives on a separate server from your Moodle installation, you can change the IP address above to match. In this case, it is recommended to not use \\'password\\' in the method field unless the connection between the two servers is secure, as \\'password\\' sends the password in plain text.

Even though you may be a teacher offline, when you are in Moodle you could have a teacher role in the course you teach in but a student role in another course where you are studying for a diploma. Because of the way Moodle works, assigning roles is done for a particular context. A site and course are examples of two different contexts. When you create a new role or tweak a pre-existing role via Administration > Site Administration > Users > Permissions > Define roles , you are asked in which context(s) you want the role to be assigned:\\n\\nHere are some examples of contexts; how to get to the assign roles screen, and when/why you would assign roles here:\\nTo assign a role in the system context, go to Site administration > Users > Permissions > \\'Assign system roles\\'.\\nAny roles assigned here apply across the whole site. It makes sense therefore that only roles that need this functionality can be assigned here. The Manager role and Course creator role are examples of two such roles. Assigning a teacher or student here would result in their being able to teach/study in every single course on the site, which is not usually desirable.\\nWhere certain custom roles are applied in the system context, it is possible to upload users to that role in bulk by adding the field sysrole1 (etc) to a CSV file.\\nsysrole column\\nsysrole column\\nsysrole column\\nsysrole column\\n\\nWhen previewed, there is a column indicating their system role:\\nPreview screen\\nPreview screen\\nPreview screen\\nPreview screen\\n\\nOnce uploaded, the users are present on the \\'Assign system roles\\' screen:\\nAssign system roles screen\\nAssign system roles screen\\nAssign system roles screen\\nAssign system roles screen\\n\\nSee Upload users for information on adding users to roles via CSV.\\nAdministration > Site Administration > Front Page>Users>Permissions>Assigned roles Those with a role in the system context do not need to be assigned a role here as well. However you might want to allow a teacher to manage items on the front page; in this instance, you would assign them the role on the Front page.\\nSee Category enrolments - users may be enrolled in the category to save enrolling them in each individual course in that category. See also Assign Manager role at category level .\\nEnrol users\\nEnrol users\\nEnrol users\\n\\nGo to the Participants page Click the \"Enrol users\" button and click those users you wish to enrol\\nThe dropdown menu at the top shows roles for which you are allowed to enrol; typically those users with lower roles than you. See Participants for more details.\\n(Within the block) Administration > Assign roles You may wish to assign roles to a block if, for instance you want specific people to see the block but for it to be hidden from others\\n(Within the activity settings) Administration > Locally assigned roles An example of this is assigning a student the teacher role locally in an individual activity like a forum so they can moderate their classmates\\' posts while still retaining the student role in the rest of the course.\\nThe user context is used for roles such as mentor, team leader or the Parent role . The role to be assigned must have \\'User\\' ticked as the context type where it is to be assigned.\\nTo assign a user the role of mentor in the context of their mentee, click the mentee\\'s profile, then Preferences then \\'Assign roles relative to this user\\'.\\nIf a mentor has lots of mentees, the role of mentor can be assigned to them all in one go as follows:\\nPut all mentees in a cohort Go to Site administration > Users > Permissions > Assign user roles to cohort\\n'},\n",

When you set up the assignment, you can make this selection in the Submission settings.

Using the Allow submissions from setting will make it possible for learners to preview upcoming activities, while at the same time, prevent them from finishing the course in the first week and not returning for additional activities or information. Likewise, the Due dates help keep the learners from lagging too far behind and decrease the likelihood that the learner will become overwhelmed by having to complete several weeks worth of work at once.\\nYou can use the assignment override feature accessed from the assignment settings as mentioned in Using Assignment .\\nClick on the assignment and then click \\'View all submissions\\'.

If required, the flag can be removed by turning editing on in the grader report , then clicking the edit grade icon, unchecking the overridden box and saving the changes.\\n\\'Revert submission to draft\\' is basically an \\'undo\\' for students who have incorrectly submitted an assignment - it allows them to go back and change the files before submitting again. \\'Allow another attempt\\' saves the submission and the feedback into the submission history and allows them to create a new submission (optionally based on their original submission), which will have its own feedback associated with it.\\nThis message will appear if you are trying an assignment as an administrator without actually being enrolled in the course, even thought the dates might look correct.

MuseScore can also export scores as PNG images or post them as attachments in Moodle forums so that they can demonstrate what they mean. This would be better for studying music theory than MIDI files or audio recordings, i.e. keeping the focus on music structure rather than on performance.\\nIf the offline assignment is aimed at showing mastery of specific skills or behaviors, you could also set up the Assignment activity in such a manner that:\\nthere are no submissions possible (no files, no online text) the assessment is by marking guide or rubric the marking guide or rubric is visible to participants\\nWith a passing grade and access restriction on the certificate, this will only become available to those who have successfully shown they master what\\'s been assessed offline. This works well for master-apprentice type learning situations. The coolest thing about this approach is that the offline assessor can use the marking guide of rubric on his tablet, to assess on the go... and that a result will be available as soon as the grade has been saved and released...

The format for the config setting is:\\ngroupname1 = button1, button2, button3\\ngroupname2 = button1, button2, button3\\nThe group names on the left have no effect on how the toolbar works; they just need to be different for each button (and no spaces please). The list of buttons says which button goes in which group and in what order. The exact word to insert here for each button is listed in the \"Toolbar config\" column above.\\nThe reason there are names for the groups is that it helps to make you think about how to group the buttons sensibly and not just stick new buttons in random locations. Ie. all the buttons in the \"files\" group interact with the file picker in some way\\nExtra plugins (for example the contributed plugin \\'Font color\\') may be added (once installed) by typing the toolbarconfig term into the toolbar config table.\\n\\nHere for example are the available colours when \\'fontcolor\\' is added:\\n\\nThe icons are displayed in related groups and the administrator can decide how many groups to display in the default collapsed state of the toolbar (that is, how many groups to display on Row 1).\\nText is automatically saved at regular intervals so it may be restored when the user returns to a form they had previously left. This setting allows the administrator to specify the time between autosaves. The default is one minute.\\nNot all plugins are enabled by default and the administrator of each site should give careful thought as to which plugins they choose to enable for their users. Here are some things to consider before enabling the non-default plugins:\\nAn emoji picker button may be added by typing \\'emojipicker\\' into the toolbar config table.\\nToolbar with emoji picker button\\nToolbar with emoji picker button\\nToolbar with emoji picker button\\n\\nTo add the emoji picker button to the top row:\\nEnter the line emoji = emojipicker under the line files = image, emoticon, media, managefiles, recordrtc, h5p Go to \\'Collapse toolbar settings\\' and change \\'Show first (n) groups when collapsed\\' to 6 and save changes.\\nThe emoticon plugin inserts text representations of the emoticons in the content. The emoticon filter is responsible for converting these text sequences into proper smiley images. The emoticon filter is not enabled by default, which is why the emoticon plugin for Atto is not enabled by default.\\nIn general, the more plugins are added to the Atto toolbar, the harder it becomes to find specific plugins. Because the no-auto link plugin is not felt to be widely used it is not enabled by default.\\nBecause this plugin is only useful for courses where text needs to be written in a mixture of both \"left to right\" and \"right to left\" languages, it is not enabled by default.\\nThere are more plugins available for Atto than just those included in a default install. \\nSee the Moodle plugins directory for additional plugins.\\nSome example plugins include the following:\\nWhile these are very popular plugins, there are downsides to enabling their use on a site. Firstly - user specified colours may conflict visually with the site colours chosen by the theme designer. Even if the colours of the content do not conflict with the colours of the current theme, if the theme is changed in future, or the content is reused on a different site conflicts may be introduced. There are 2 possible types of conflicts, the first is just a visually unappealing combination of colours, the second is a combination of colours that may produce text that is hard to read for some people. It is preferable if the theme designer uses some interesting colours that meet the accessibility standards required for the site in the theme for the site, and the person creating the content simply uses the proper heading levels (for example) to make use of those styles.\\nThis is a plugin for easily making Embedded Answers (Cloze) question type questions inside the standard Moodle Atto text  editor.\\nThis plugin allows you view the content as it would be seen by a reader.\\nThere are a number of chemistry plugins that support chemistry equations and structures.\\nThere are a number of plugins that support importing text from other sources. \\nThe Paste special plugin minimises the amount of superfluous HTML markup\\nincluded when pasting content from an external editor such as Microsoft Word.\\nThe Word Import plugin (beta) supports importing an entire Word document, \\nincluding embedded images.\\nEquation editor commands may be removed, added or reordered in Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Text editors > Atto HTML editor > Equation editor settings .\\n\\nStyles, colours and sizes for tables and their borders may be enabled from Administration > Site administraton >Plugins > Test editors > Atto HTML editor > Table settings.\\n'},\n",

This way is best where there are many markers, and/or you don\\'t have a provisional date to release marks and feedback.\\nOne marker, Marker, wants to release all grades at the same time\\nMarker enables \"Use marking workflow\" Marker marks each submission and transitions the grading to \"Marking completed\" as each submission is graded. Marker then uses the batch operations to transition all grades to \"Released\" at the same time.\\nMultiple markers,\\nMarker enables \"Use marking workflow\" Marker marks each submission and transitions the grading to \"Marking completed\" as each submission is graded. Marker then uses the batch operations to transition all grades to \"Released\" at the same time.\\nIf you don\\'t have an internet connection or prefer to grade outside Moodle, you can do so (including with anonymous submissions).\\nThese easy stages explained below:\\nDownload the submissions Download the spreadsheet (grading worksheet) to record grades. Grade and annotate (if applicable) the submitted work. Upload the completed grading worksheet. Upload the annotated submissions (if applicable).\\nNote:You cannot upload marks and feedback to Moodle if you have enabled Rubrics or Marking Guides.\\nGo to the settings of that assignment.\\nFor Feedback types, ensure that the Moodle Assignment settings, Feedback comments, Feedback files, and Offline grading worksheet are ticked.\\nYou can download a zip file containing all of the assignment submissions by selecting ‘Download all submissions’ from the \\'Grading actions\\' menu at the top of the grading table, or in the settings menu.\\nFile submissions will be downloaded in the format uploaded by the student. Online text submissions will be downloaded as html files. Each file in the zip will be named with the student first and last name followed by a unique identifier (not the user ID number).\\nIf each submission is more than a single file, then submissions may be downloaded in folders by ticking the option \\'Download submissions in folders\\' (below the grading table). Each submission is put in a separate folder, with the folder structure kept for any subfolders, and files are not renamed. Each folder will be named with the student first and last name followed by a unique identifier (not the user ID number).\\nYou can also download selected assignment submissions (rather than all of them) by selecting the ones you want and then choosing \\'With selected....Download selected submissions\\'.\\nNext, to download the spreadsheet in which you\\'ll enter the grades and brief comments, return to the Moodle Assignment page and from its Grading action drop-down menu choose Download grading worksheet and save that file (keep its csv file format).\\nNote: Helpfully that downloaded worksheet will contain any existing grades and summary comments which have already been given for that assignment i.e. if marking has already started. However, to see pre-existing comments fully you may need to set your spreadsheet to \\'wrap text\\' within cells.\\nAfter downloading the submissions and the grading worksheet:\\nOpen a downloaded assignment file to assess it. Open the csv file in a spreadsheet editor e.g. Excel. For that student\\'s record (if anonymous, a number corresponding to the submission file name will display), enter grades in the Grade column and summary comments in the Feedback comments column for each student. Leave the other data untouched unless you know exactly what you\\'re doing. Repeat as needed. Save the csv file.\\nNote: Take care to enter data in the correct column of the spreadsheet.\\nIf you are annotating the submissions to return to students as feedback:\\nOpen a downloaded submission. Carry out your annotations. Save it in its original place i.e. the folder corresponding to that student. Repeat as needed.\\nIf you have separate feedback files to upload to students:\\nSave these within that student\\'s folder. You can give students multiple feedback files in this way e.g. annotations on their work along with a separate pro forma.\\nNote: Don\\'t change the name or location of the folder - Moodle needs this information to allocate the files correctly.\\nCompress (zip) all the feedback files:\\nLocate the folder containing the feedback files in Moodle, select them all (Ctrl+A within the folder), then zip them: Windows: Right click one of the selected files and Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder. Mac: Right Click (or Ctrl+click) one of the selected files and click Compress. They are now ready for upload (see below).\\nWindows: Right click one of the selected files and Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder. Mac: Right Click (or Ctrl+click) one of the selected files and click Compress.\\nWhen you are ready to upload grades and summary feedback:\\nClick on the assignment name on the Moodle course homepage to access the summary page and click View/grade all submissions . From the Grading action drop-down menu choose Upload grading worksheet . Click Choose a file... and upload the grading worksheet to Moodle, or drag the csv file to the arrow and wait for the file name to appear in the box. There is a checkbox to overwrite records that have been modified more recently in Moodle than in the spreadsheet - only check this if you want to spreadsheet to overwrite all Moodle records, including ones made more recently than the spreadsheet. Click Upload grading worksheet ; a Confirmation box displays the students grades and feedback that will be imported - check this carefully. If you are ready to proceed, click Confirm ; a summary of updates displays. Click Continue .\\nClick on the assignment name on the Moodle course homepage to access the summary page and click View/grade all submissions . From the Grading action drop-down menu choose Upload multiple feedback files in a zip . Click Choose a file... and upload the zipped assignments file to Moodle, or drag the compressed/zipped file to the arrow and wait for the file name to appear in the box. Click Import feedback file(s) . The Confirmation box will list all the feedback files and student names that will be imported. Click Confirm ; the next screen summarises the changes. Click Continue \\ufeff. From the page containing the Grading Table, you can check your feedback files by enabling Quick grading (see Options at the bottom of that page) and scrolling horizontally, if needed.\\nFor an assignment with no file submissions, see the discussion upload feedback files without student file submissions for details of what to do.\\nIf you have high level feedback you want to give to an entire cohort, it is generally a good idea to give this feedback in the context of the assignment, rather than e.g. separately via a Forum. Moodle allows you to select some or all students and attach a single, common feedback file to their assignment feedback. This common feedback will appear to each student along with any other individual feedback files you have prepared for each.\\nPrepare the single file of feedback. Click on the link to the Assignment; its summary page displays. Click View all submissions ; the assignment\\'s Grading Table displays. Use the checkboxes to select all or some students to receive the feedback (you may first prefer to configure the Grading Table to show as many students as possible on a single page). Underneath the Grading Table click the With selected... menu, choose Send feedback files , then click Go ; a page displays a list of selected students above a file upload area. Upload the file of feedback you prepapred, or drag it to the arrow and wait for the file name to appear in the box. Click Send feedback files ; the Grading Table displays again. Check your file is in place by scrolling horizontally to the Feedback files column.\\n'},\n",

This works well for younger children who will only manage a sentence or two and works just as well for higher education students who write more.\\nAdvantage - quick for the student to get started; no need to use a word-processing program and upload the file. The text is saved on a regular basis so it will be preserved if the  student loses the page for some reason. Disadvantage: if the word count is expected to be large, setting Online text to No and File submission to Yes might be a better option.\\nSet File submission to Yes, set the number of files you will allow using the Maximum number of uploaded files setting and the file sizes by using the Maximum submission size setting.\\nAdvantage - better than students emailing work as the whole class\\'s work is collated in one space on your course. Markers can provide comments directly on the student work. Advantage - with \"Attempts reopened\" enabled, teachers can see the progression through various drafts of a student\\'s work. Disadvantage - assignments must downloaded to be viewed (but they can be downloaded in bulk ) and the teacher needs the appropriate program to open them.\\nSet File submission to Yes, and use Maximum number of uploaded files to set the maximum number of separate files they can upload\\nAdvantage - all project files are in one assignment area for grading so they get a single grade. Disadvantage - all project files are in one assignment area for grading - so they can only have  a single grade!\\nSet up an assignment allowing online text submission and get students to use the Moodle media icon to add video/sound/image files.\\nInvestigate the Quiz module.

If you have Ghostscript enabled on your server and the students upload PDF files, you can annotate them inline. See the section Annotating PDF files below. Disadvantage: if students upload other file types, you have to download them, comment and then re-upload them.\\nIf comments are enabled site-wide , students will be able to add submission comments; if comments are disabled site-wide, students will not be given the option to add submission comments.\\nIn the settings set Require students click submit button to Yes. Students can then control when their draft work is submitted to the teacher.\\nIn the settings set Require students click submit button to No. Students can continue to make changes to their assignment and at no point do they \\'submit\\'. If the work will be graded at some point it is recommended that either Prevent late submissions is set to Yes to ensure that no changes can be made after the due date, or all submissions are locked when grading commences to ensure that the work is not altered during grading.\\nAdvantage: the work remains in one place and is constantly improved, graded (if needed) and improved again. Disadvantage: there is no record/history of previous attempts (such as with the Wiki ). The online text assignment does not replicate the display of a journal or blog where each new entry is additional to the previous ones.\\nIn the settings, set \"Students submit in groups\" to Yes.

The assignment will only be classed as submitted when each member has contributed, and once one student has submitted, the remaining members\\'s names will be displayed for the group to see who still needs to add their input.\\nIn the settings, choose \\'Anonymous submissions\\'. When students submit assignments, their names will be replaced by randomly-generated participant numbers so you will not know who is who.

Assuming you are not hiding grades in the ways outlined below, then Moodle will send a notification.\\nNote: How students receive Moodle notifications depends on your local default settings, and any changes students have made to those.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssessors often decide to hide grades and feedback until marking is complete and finalised, and then release them all at once. There are two alternatives for this.\\nHide the item in the Grader Report . This is convenient if there are few markers and you have decided a provision date for releasing the marks and feedback. Or enable Use marking workflow in the Assignment\\'s settings. This way is best where there are many markers, and/or you don\\'t have a provisional date to release marks and feedback.\\nOne marker, Marker, wants to release all grades at the same time\\nMarker enables \"Use marking workflow\" Marker marks each submission and transitions the grading to \"Marking completed\" as each submission is graded. Marker then uses the batch operations to transition all grades to \"Released\" at the same time.\\nMultiple markers,\\nMarker enables \"Use marking workflow\" Marker marks each submission and transitions the grading to \"Marking completed\" as each submission is graded. Marker then uses the batch operations to transition all grades to \"Released\" at the same time.\\nIf you don\\'t have an internet connection or prefer to grade outside Moodle, you can do so (including with anonymous submissions).\\nThese easy stages explained below:\\nDownload the submissions Download the spreadsheet (grading worksheet) to record grades. Grade and annotate (if applicable) the submitted work. Upload the completed grading worksheet. Upload the annotated submissions (if applicable).\\nNote:You cannot upload marks and feedback to Moodle if you have enabled Rubrics or Marking Guides.\\nGo to the settings of that assignment.\\nFor Feedback types, ensure that the Moodle Assignment settings, Feedback comments, Feedback files, and Offline grading worksheet are ticked.\\nYou can download a zip file containing all of the assignment submissions by selecting ‘Download all submissions’ from the \\'Grading actions\\' menu at the top of the grading table, or in the settings menu.\\nFile submissions will be downloaded in the format uploaded by the student. Online text submissions will be downloaded as html files. Each file in the zip will be named with the student first and last name followed by a unique identifier (not the user ID number).\\nIf each submission is more than a single file, then submissions may be downloaded in folders by ticking the option \\'Download submissions in folders\\' (below the grading table). Each submission is put in a separate folder, with the folder structure kept for any subfolders, and files are not renamed. Each folder will be named with the student first and last name followed by a unique identifier (not the user ID number).\\nYou can also download selected assignment submissions (rather than all of them) by selecting the ones you want and then choosing \\'With selected....Download selected submissions\\'.\\nNext, to download the spreadsheet in which you\\'ll enter the grades and brief comments, return to the Moodle Assignment page and from its Grading action drop-down menu choose Download grading worksheet and save that file (keep its csv file format).\\nNote: Helpfully that downloaded worksheet will contain any existing grades and summary comments which have already been given for that assignment i.e. if marking has already started. However, to see pre-existing comments fully you may need to set your spreadsheet to \\'wrap text\\' within cells.\\nAfter downloading the submissions and the grading worksheet:\\nOpen a downloaded assignment file to assess it. Open the csv file in a spreadsheet editor e.g. Excel. For that student\\'s record (if anonymous, a number corresponding to the submission file name will display), enter grades in the Grade column and summary comments in the Feedback comments column for each student. Leave the other data untouched unless you know exactly what you\\'re doing. Repeat as needed. Save the csv file.\\nNote: Take care to enter data in the correct column of the spreadsheet.\\nIf you are annotating the submissions to return to students as feedback:\\nOpen a downloaded submission. Carry out your annotations. Save it in its original place i.e. the folder corresponding to that student. Repeat as needed.\\nIf you have separate feedback files to upload to students:\\nSave these within that student\\'s folder. You can give students multiple feedback files in this way e.g. annotations on their work along with a separate pro forma.\\nNote: Don\\'t change the name or location of the folder - Moodle needs this information to allocate the files correctly.\\nCompress (zip) all the feedback files:\\nLocate the folder containing the feedback files in Moodle, select them all (Ctrl+A within the folder), then zip them: Windows: Right click one of the selected files and Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder. Mac: Right Click (or Ctrl+click) one of the selected files and click Compress. They are now ready for upload (see below).\\nWindows: Right click one of the selected files and Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder. Mac: Right Click (or Ctrl+click) one of the selected files and click Compress.\\nWhen you are ready to upload grades and summary feedback:\\nClick on the assignment name on the Moodle course homepage to access the summary page and click View/grade all submissions . From the Grading action drop-down menu choose Upload grading worksheet . Click Choose a file... and upload the grading worksheet to Moodle, or drag the csv file to the arrow and wait for the file name to appear in the box. There is a checkbox to overwrite records that have been modified more recently in Moodle than in the spreadsheet - only check this if you want to spreadsheet to overwrite all Moodle records, including ones made more recently than the spreadsheet. Click Upload grading worksheet ; a Confirmation box displays the students grades and feedback that will be imported - check this carefully. If you are ready to proceed, click Confirm ; a summary of updates displays. Click Continue .\\nClick on the assignment name on the Moodle course homepage to access the summary page and click View/grade all submissions . From the Grading action drop-down menu choose Upload multiple feedback files in a zip . Click Choose a file... and upload the zipped assignments file to Moodle, or drag the compressed/zipped file to the arrow and wait for the file name to appear in the box. Click Import feedback file(s) . The Confirmation box will list all the feedback files and student names that will be imported. Click Confirm ; the next screen summarises the changes. Click Continue \\ufeff. From the page containing the Grading Table, you can check your feedback files by enabling Quick grading (see Options at the bottom of that page) and scrolling horizontally, if needed.\\nFor an assignment with no file submissions, see the discussion upload feedback files without student file submissions for details of what to do.\\nIf you have high level feedback you want to give to an entire cohort, it is generally a good idea to give this feedback in the context of the assignment, rather than e.g. separately via a Forum. Moodle allows you to select some or all students and attach a single, common feedback file to their assignment feedback. This common feedback will appear to each student along with any other individual feedback files you have prepared for each.\\nPrepare the single file of feedback. Click on the link to the Assignment; its summary page displays. Click View all submissions ; the assignment\\'s Grading Table displays. Use the checkboxes to select all or some students to receive the feedback (you may first prefer to configure the Grading Table to show as many students as possible on a single page). Underneath the Grading Table click the With selected... menu, choose Send feedback files , then click Go ; a page displays a list of selected students above a file upload area. Upload the file of feedback you prepapred, or drag it to the arrow and wait for the file name to appear in the box. Click Send feedback files ; the Grading Table displays again. Check your file is in place by scrolling horizontally to the Feedback files column.\\n'},\n",

See Big Blue Button website for more general information.\\nDeft response block provides a near native way to add audio conferencing to Moodle. Teachers can add buttons to the block any where blocks can be used in a course. Pressing one of the buttons allows learners to converse with each other about the Moodle activities where the block is located. A free service provides minimal networking services. User data and authentication are handled exclusively by the Moodle server where the block is installed. See deftly.us for more information.\\nOpenmeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using API functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.  OpenMeetings is a project of the Apache.  See Moodle plugin for more details.\\nPoodll allows you to record audio into forums, pages, anywhere with a text editor. Recordings are done via the Poodll server hosted by Amazon and transferred to your Moodle site. The Poodll set of tools (filter, assignment 2.3 type, repository, question type) is available from the plugins directory. It is simple to install and doesn't require any particular PHP expertise.\\nPoodll Read Aloud is an online testing system designed to assist teachers in evaluating their students' reading fluency as WPM(Words Correct Per Minute) scores.

Select the self-registration plugin in the Common  settings.\\nWarning: Enabling Self-registration results in the possibility of spammers creating accounts in order to use forum posts, blog entries etc. for spam. See Reducing spam in Moodle for ways of minimizing the risk.\\nSee the section \\'Is this your first time here?\\' instructions in Managing authentication .\\nThe difference is that self-registration is the general term for having a user create an account themselves. There could be many ways to do that, for instance to allow users to sign up with no email at all. Almost all web applications these days, however, require users to first confirm their email address. This is to prevent spam accounts and other security issues. Moodle has only one type on self-registration currently, which is email-based.\\nTherefore: to allow users to create self-registered accounts, you must do two things:\\nEnable email-based self-registration authentication plugin to allow such users to be able to log in. Set Site administration > Plugins > Authentication > Managing authentication > Common settings > Self registration from Disable to Email-based self-registration to allow potential users to create their accounts.\\nThis division of labor into two settings means that it is possible to Disable Self-registration to prevent accounts, but as long as the Authentication method Email-self registration is still enabled, users will still be able to login and use their accounts.\\nYou could do this in a case where you may wish to allow signup for a limited period (a day, week, month) to allow users to self-create their accounts, then Disable creating new accounts while allowing the already created users to log in.\\nWarning: Enabling self-registration results in the possibility of spammers creating accounts in order to use forum posts, blog entries etc. for spam. This risk can be minimized by limiting self registration to particular email domains with the allowed email domains setting in Site administration > Plugins> Authentication > Manage authentication . Alternatively, self-registration may be enabled for a short period of time to allow users to create accounts, and then later disabled.\\nSee also: Reducing Spam in Moodle\\nEmail based sends out an email with a message and confirmation link to users when they sign up. Possible reason why this make not be working, and also a useful order to troubleshoot this, is:\\nIs email working at all from Moodle for other features such as forum posts? If not, check that you have Messaging enabled and that your Email Settings are set. Is email for new sign ups working? You can test this yourself by signing up with a dummy test user and a valid email. Has the user checked their spam or junk folder? The email comes by default from your Moodle administrator account, and it is not uncommon for that to be flagged by some systems as potential spam. Did the user make a typo or other error in their email address or are they using the wrong account?\\nSome good troubleshooting advice on the Community Forums\\nIf you are creating ONE manual account, then no.\\nSee this discussion: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=212648 See Feature request here: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-19390 See discussion http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=117005\\nBulk upload can be set up to send e-mails.

This means the user will not be able to log into Moodle, but their account is otherwise unchanged.\\nNote: Users will not receive any error or other message when they try to log in but it simply will not allow them in. So it will appear as though their password was incorrect and they may attempt to reset it. Consider this issue when using No login, in order to reduce support issues.\\nTo do so:\\nAccess the user\\'s profile page. In the Settings block, click \"Edit profile\". Select \"No login\" as the authentication method (if the setting isn\\'t shown, click the \"Show advanced\" button to reveal it). Click the \"Update profile\" button at the bottom of the page.\\nYes. You can change any user account from one authentication method to another in Moodle, but you are of course responsible for making sure that the information matches and is valid in the new method.\\nYou can set this manually for each user in their user profile by changing the \"Authentication\" field. This can also be changed en masse for many users by using the User file upload tool Upload_users and changing the field called \"auth\".\\nSee this blog post on Changing manual accounts to LDAP using MySQL database and this ad-hoc query https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/ad-hoc_contributed_reports#List_of_users_with_Authentication .\\nWhen NTLM SSO is enabled on a Moodle site the SSO function always logs the user who is logged into the computer into Moodle. Sometimes you may need to override this feature and login to Moodle as another user. Example: when a teacher or site administrator needs to login to the students computer to troubleshoot a problem. Or the teacher simply needs to access functionality that is not available to the student and the teacher is not anywhere near her own computer.\\nThe problem is that the Moodle logout option is not available when SSO is enabled - the user simply gets logged back into Moodle. To bypass the SSO you can add this to the url:\\n/login/index.php?authldap_skipntlmsso=1\\nExample: http://yourschool.com/login/index.php?authldap_skipntlmsso=1\\nThe NTLM SSO will be disabled (for this login only) and you will get the regular Moodle login page.\\nSee the Using Moodle Bypass NTML SSO for Moode 2.2 forum discussion for details.\\n'},\n",

The format for the config setting is:\\ngroupname1 = button1, button2, button3\\ngroupname2 = button1, button2, button3\\nThe group names on the left have no effect on how the toolbar works; they just need to be different for each button (and no spaces please). The list of buttons says which button goes in which group and in what order. The exact word to insert here for each button is listed in the \"Toolbar config\" column above.\\nThe reason there are names for the groups is that it helps to make you think about how to group the buttons sensibly and not just stick new buttons in random locations. Ie. all the buttons in the \"files\" group interact with the file picker in some way\\nExtra plugins (for example the contributed plugin \\'Font color\\') may be added (once installed) by typing the toolbarconfig term into the toolbar config table.\\n\\nHere for example are the available colours when \\'fontcolor\\' is added:\\n\\nThe icons are displayed in related groups and the administrator can decide how many groups to display in the default collapsed state of the toolbar (that is, how many groups to display on Row 1).\\nText is automatically saved at regular intervals so it may be restored when the user returns to a form they had previously left. This setting allows the administrator to specify the time between autosaves. The default is one minute.\\nNot all plugins are enabled by default and the administrator of each site should give careful thought as to which plugins they choose to enable for their users.

The emoticon filter is responsible for converting these text sequences into proper smiley images. The emoticon filter is not enabled by default, which is why the emoticon plugin for Atto is not enabled by default.\\nIn general, the more plugins are added to the Atto toolbar, the harder it becomes to find specific plugins. Because the no-auto link plugin is not felt to be widely used it is not enabled by default.\\nBecause this plugin is only useful for courses where text needs to be written in a mixture of both \"left to right\" and \"right to left\" languages, it is not enabled by default.\\nThere are more plugins available for Atto than just those included in a default install. \\nSee the Moodle plugins directory for additional plugins.\\nSome example plugins include the following:\\nWhile these are very popular plugins, there are downsides to enabling their use on a site. Firstly - user specified colours may conflict visually with the site colours chosen by the theme designer. Even if the colours of the content do not conflict with the colours of the current theme, if the theme is changed in future, or the content is reused on a different site conflicts may be introduced. There are 2 possible types of conflicts, the first is just a visually unappealing combination of colours, the second is a combination of colours that may produce text that is hard to read for some people. It is preferable if the theme designer uses some interesting colours that meet the accessibility standards required for the site in the theme for the site, and the person creating the content simply uses the proper heading levels (for example) to make use of those styles.\\nThis is a plugin for easily making Embedded Answers (Cloze) question type questions inside the standard Moodle Atto text  editor.\\nThis plugin allows you view the content as it would be seen by a reader.\\nThere are a number of chemistry plugins that support chemistry equations and structures.\\nThere are a number of plugins that support importing text from other sources. \\nThe Paste special plugin minimises the amount of superfluous HTML markup\\nincluded when pasting content from an external editor such as Microsoft Word.\\nThe Word Import plugin (beta) supports importing an entire Word document, \\nincluding embedded images.\\nEquation editor commands may be removed, added or reordered in Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Text editors > Atto HTML editor > Equation editor settings .\\n\\nStyles, colours and sizes for tables and their borders may be enabled from Administration > Site administraton >Plugins > Test editors > Atto HTML editor > Table settings.\\n'},\n",

This will result in a \"Is this your first time here?\" instructions and a \"Create new account\" button being displayed on the login page.\\nNote: The Email-based self-registration authentication plugin must be enabled to allow users who previously self-registered to login with that plugin. Selecting Email-based self-registration as the self registration method allows potential users to self register.\\nSelf-registration can be a source of spam accounts. To reduce this see the section \\'How can I prevent spam accounts if I use self-registration?\\' in the Authentication FAQ .\\nIn Moodle 3.4.2 onwards, if self registration is enabled, a \\'Digital age of consent verification\\' may also be enabled. See Privacy for further details.\\nIf this is enabled then users can use either their email address or their username when logging in.\\nBy default, usernames must all be unique. If this setting is set to yes, it allows users to be created by an admin or uploaded that have the same email address as another account. (It does NOT allow users to sign up for an account with an email address which is the same as another account.)\\nNote: This feature can result in confused users. Password resets will be sent to the email account so everyone with access to that email address can gain access to the other user\\'s accounts, and the different users may be confused as to what email was sent to who. Where possible it is recommended you encourage users to mail aliases instead (such as gmail\\'s + alias feature) so that you can differentiate the emails received about the accounts.\\nIf an external database such as LDAP is used, then normally when a user logs in for the first time, a new account is created for them. Disable this setting if you don\\'t want this to happen but if you only want existing users to be able to access the site.\\nYou can hide or show the guest login button on the login page. Hiding the guest login button disables guest access to the Moodle site, however logged-in users can still enter any courses which allow guest access without being required to enrol.\\nBy default, there is no limit to the number of concurrent browser logins. (If a user is concerned about this, they can view their Browser sessions page.) This setting allows you to specify how many concurrent browser logins are allowed. Once the limit is reached, the oldest session will be terminated. Note that this does not work with Single sign on plugins.\\nYou may configure an alternate login URL for your site and set this to an absolute URL or to a relative URL. If it is set as a relative URL, it will be assumed as relative to $CFG->wwwroot . For example, your $CFG->wwwroot is set to http://example.com/moodle and your $CFG->alternateloginurl is set to /alternate/login.php . The absolute URL of the alternate login URL is assumed to be in http://example.com/moodle/alternate/login.php .\\nThis should be used with care, since a mistake in the URL or on the actual login page can lock you out of your site. If you do mess it up, you can remove the entry alternateloginurl from your database (table mdl_config) using, e.g., phpmyadmin for mysql. Depending on your configuration, you will also have to clear your caches with php admin/cli/purge_caches.php .\\nYou can read some more useful information about changing $CFG->alternateloginurl = \\' your url \\'; on the following discussion .\\nIf your lost password handling is performed entirely outside of Moodle (for example, only by a help desk), you can set the url of that service here. Anybody pressing a \"lost password\" link in Moodle will be redirected to this URL. Note that this will disable all of Moodle\\'s lost password recovery options regardless of authentication method(s) in use.\\nThe instructions field is for providing custom login instructions on the login page. If the field is left blank then the default login instructions will be displayed.\\nLogin page with default instructions displayed\\nLogin page with default instructions displayed\\nLogin page with default instructions displayed\\n\\nLogin page with custom instructions displayed\\nLogin page with custom instructions displayed\\nLogin page with custom instructions displayed\\n\\nNote that this message only applies to certain authentication methods, such as Manual and Self-registration, and does not apply to most external methods that pull users from external lists (LDAP, etc.).\\nMultiple languages\\nCustom instructions in more than one language may be provided as follows:\\nGo to Site administration > Language > Language customisation Select a language then click the button \\'Open language pack for editing\\' then click continue Select moodle.php and enter loginsteps as string identifier then click \\'Show strings\\' Enter your custom login instructions in the local customisation text box Click the button \\'Save changes to the language pack\\' then click continue Repeat the steps for other languages\\nCustom login instructions in English can be provided by editing the English language pack.\\nAuthentication may be restricted to particular email domains when using Email-based self-registration so that, for example, only students with a university email can login.\\nYou can choose to enforce email domains only when users create an account using Email-based self-registration i.e. after creating an account, users may change their email to a different domain.\\nA CAPTCHA is a program that can tell whether its user is a human or a computer. CAPTCHAs are used by many websites to prevent abuse from bots, or automated programs usually written to generate spam. No computer program can read distorted text as well as humans can, so bots cannot navigate sites protected by CAPTCHAs.\\nNew in 4.3 The \"Enable reCAPTCHA for login\" setting allows you to add a reCAPTCHA option to the login screen.\\nSpam protection may be added to the Email-based self-registration new account form with a CAPTCHA element - a challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human.\\nReCAPTCHA keys can be obtained from http://www.google.com/recaptcha by signing up for an account (free) then entering a domain. The site and secret keys provided can then be copied and pasted into the recaptchapublickey and recaptchaprivatekey fields in the manage authentication common settings, located under Site administration > Plugins > Authentication > Manage authentication, and the changes saved.\\nIn addition to setting reCAPTCHA keys, email-based self-registration should be set as the self registration authentication plugin in the manage authentication common settings and the reCAPTCHA element should be enabled in the Email-based self-registration settings.\\n'},\n",

A search service is created with both, so if you added Azure Search to your subscription, follow these steps to get the necessary information:\\nIn the Azure portal, open the search service page from the dashboard or find your service in the service list. Get the endpoint at Overview > Essentials > Url . An example endpoint might look like https://my-service-name.search.windows.net . Get the api-key in Settings > Keys . There are two admin keys for redundancy in case you want to roll over keys. Admin keys grant the write permissions on your service, necessary for creating and loading indexes. You can use either the primary or secondary key for write operations.\\nOnce you have setup an Azure Search service you can now install the Moodle plugin.\\nTo install the plugin in Moodle via the command line:\\nGet the code from GitHub or the Moodle Plugin Directory. Copy or clone code into: <moodledir>/search/engine/azure Run the upgrade: sudo -u www-data php admin/cli/upgrade Note: the user may be different to www-data on your system.\\nTo install the plugin in Moodle via the Moodle User Interface:\\nLog into your Moodle as an Administrator. Navigate to: Site administration > Plugins > Install Plugins Install plugin from Moodle Plugin directory or via zip upload.\\nOnce you have setup an Azure Search service you can now configure the Moodle plugin.\\nLog into Moodle as an administrator Set up the plugin in Site administration > Plugins > Search > Manage global search by selecting azure as the search engine. Configure the Azure Search plugin at: Site administration > Plugins > Search > Azure Set URL, API Key and API version of your Elasticsearch server Set the Index name you want to use for your Azure Search service. To create the index and populate Azure Searcg with your site's data, run this CLI script. sudo -u www-data php search/cli/indexer.php --force --reindex Enable Global search in Site administration > Advanced features\\nThis plugin provides optional file indexing support.\\nThis plugin uses Apache Tika for file indexing support. This is a separate service to this plugin and core Moodle.\\nTika parses files, extracts the text, and return it via a REST API.\\nIf you wish to use file indexing you will need access to a Tika service. An example setup can be found below.\\nSetting up a Tika test service is straight forward. In most cases on a Linux environment, you can simply download the Java JAR then run the service. wget http://apache.mirror.amaze.com.au/tika/tika-server-1.16.jar java -jar tika-server-1.16.jar\\nThis will start Tika on the host. By default the Tika service is available on: http://localhost:9998\\nOnce a Tika service is available the Azure Search plugin in Moodle needs to be configured for file indexing support. Assuming you have already followed the basic installation steps, to enable file indexing support:\\nConfigure the Azure Search plugin at: Site administration > Plugins > Search > Azure Select the Enable file indexing checkbox. Set Tika hostname and Tika port of your Tika service. If you followed the basic Tika setup instructions the defaults should not need changing. Click the Save Changes button.\\nFrom the Apache Tika website:\\nThe Apache Tika™ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more. You can find the latest release on the download page. Please see the Getting Started page for more information on how to start using Tika.\\n\"}]},\n",

This is done by simply unchecking the above three options.

       "    'text': 'Set Online text to Yes. This works well for younger children who will only manage a sentence or two and works just as well for higher education students who write more.\\nAdvantage - quick for the student to get started; no need to use a word-processing program and upload the file. The text is saved on a regular basis so it will be preserved if the  student loses the page for some reason. Disadvantage: if the word count is expected to be large, setting Online text to No and File submission to Yes might be a better option.\\nSet File submission to Yes, set the number of files you will allow using the Maximum number of uploaded files setting and the file sizes by using the Maximum submission size setting.\\nAdvantage - better than students emailing work as the whole class\\'s work is collated in one space on your course. Markers can provide comments directly on the student work. Advantage - with \"Attempts reopened\" enabled, teachers can see the progression through various drafts of a student\\'s work. Disadvantage - assignments must downloaded to be viewed (but they can be downloaded in bulk ) and the teacher needs the appropriate program to open them.\\nSet File submission to Yes, and use Maximum number of uploaded files to set the maximum number of separate files they can upload\\nAdvantage - all project files are in one assignment area for grading so they get a single grade. Disadvantage - all project files are in one assignment area for grading - so they can only have  a single grade!\\nSet up an assignment allowing online text submission and get students to use the Moodle media icon to add video/sound/image files.\\nInvestigate the Quiz module. Assignments are really just for a single question.\\nUncheck the submission types when setting up the assignment. Students won\\'t be required to do anything but you can use the assignment to grade them for work done outside of Moodle.\\nSet up an assignment allowing file submissions .\\nAdvantage: useful for teachers who like using the \"comment\" options in word-processing programs for example. If you have Ghostscript enabled on your server and the students upload PDF files, you can annotate them inline. See the section Annotating PDF files below. Disadvantage: if students upload other file types, you have to download them, comment and then re-upload them.\\nIf comments are enabled site-wide , students will be able to add submission comments; if comments are disabled site-wide, students will not be given the option to add submission comments.\\nIn the settings set Require students click submit button to Yes. Students can then control when their draft work is submitted to the teacher.\\nIn the settings set Require students click submit button to No. Students can continue to make changes to their assignment and at no point do they \\'submit\\'. If the work will be graded at some point it is recommended that either Prevent late submissions is set to Yes to ensure that no changes can be made after the due date, or all submissions are locked when grading commences to ensure that the work is not altered during grading.\\nAdvantage: the work remains in one place and is constantly improved, graded (if needed) and improved again. Disadvantage: there is no record/history of previous attempts (such as with the Wiki ). The online text assignment does not replicate the display of a journal or blog where each new entry is additional to the previous ones.\\nIn the settings, set \"Students submit in groups\" to Yes. If you just do this, then once one student has submitted, the assignment will be flagged as submitted even if the others haven\\'t contributed. If you want to ensure everyone has an input, set \"Require students click submit button\" to Yes and then change \"Require all group members to submit\" to Yes. The assignment will only be classed as submitted when each member has contributed, and once one student has submitted, the remaining members\\'s names will be displayed for the group to see who still needs to add their input.\\nIn the settings, choose \\'Anonymous submissions\\'. When students submit assignments, their names will be replaced by randomly-generated participant numbers so you will not know who is who. Note that this is not totally anonymous because you can reveal their identities in the assignment settings and you can work out identities from the logs - so this might  not be suitable if your establishment has very precise privacy requirements.\\nIn the settings, choose \"Offline grading worksheet\". When students have submitted, click \"View/grade all submissions\" and you can download their assignments from the link \"Download all submissions\" and download the grading sheet from the link \"Download grading worksheet\". You can then edit grades and re-upload the grading worksheet. You can also upload multiple feedback files in a zip from this drop down menu. See Assignment settings for an explanation of how to use the \"upload multiple feedback files as zip\" feature.\\nUse \\'marking workflow\\' as explained in Assignment settings .\\nAsk your administrator to enable the time limit feature from Site administration > Plugins > Assignment settings > Enable timed assignments and you will then have the option from the Availability section.\\nUse \\'marking allocation\\' as explained in Assignment settings .\\n'},\n",

Note that because group membership is not itself anonymised, this may make anonymised submissions that bit less anonymous, though as long as the groups aren\\'t very small this should be acceptable.\\nAn alternative is to use marking allocation - this allows anyone with a teacher role to allocate one marker to each submission. This works particularly well if marking is allocated by subject specialism.\\nIf you will be assigning grades to student work, you may want to take note of the submission status before you begin the marking process.

Please note:\\nif you want to give feedback, you need to use the more detailed Grade interface. Quick grading is incompatible with advanced grading e.g. Rubrics, and is not recommended when there are multiple markers.

Marker then uses the batch operations to transition all grades to \"Released\" at the same time.\\nIf you don\\'t have an internet connection or prefer to grade outside Moodle, you can do so (including with anonymous submissions).\\nThese easy stages explained below:\\nDownload the submissions Download the spreadsheet (grading worksheet) to record grades. Grade and annotate (if applicable) the submitted work. Upload the completed grading worksheet. Upload the annotated submissions (if applicable).\\nNote:You cannot upload marks and feedback to Moodle if you have enabled Rubrics or Marking Guides.\\nGo to the settings of that assignment.\\nFor Feedback types, ensure that the Moodle Assignment settings, Feedback comments, Feedback files, and Offline grading worksheet are ticked.\\nYou can download a zip file containing all of the assignment submissions by selecting ‘Download all submissions’ from the \\'Grading actions\\' menu at the top of the grading table, or in the settings menu.\\nFile submissions will be downloaded in the format uploaded by the student. Online text submissions will be downloaded as html files. Each file in the zip will be named with the student first and last name followed by a unique identifier (not the user ID number).\\nIf each submission is more than a single file, then submissions may be downloaded in folders by ticking the option \\'Download submissions in folders\\' (below the grading table). Each submission is put in a separate folder, with the folder structure kept for any subfolders, and files are not renamed. Each folder will be named with the student first and last name followed by a unique identifier (not the user ID number).\\nYou can also download selected assignment submissions (rather than all of them) by selecting the ones you want and then choosing \\'With selected....Download selected submissions\\'.\\nNext, to download the spreadsheet in which you\\'ll enter the grades and brief comments, return to the Moodle Assignment page and from its Grading action drop-down menu choose Download grading worksheet and save that file (keep its csv file format).\\nNote: Helpfully that downloaded worksheet will contain any existing grades and summary comments which have already been given for that assignment i.e. if marking has already started. However, to see pre-existing comments fully you may need to set your spreadsheet to \\'wrap text\\' within cells.\\nAfter downloading the submissions and the grading worksheet:\\nOpen a downloaded assignment file to assess it. Open the csv file in a spreadsheet editor e.g. Excel. For that student\\'s record (if anonymous, a number corresponding to the submission file name will display), enter grades in the Grade column and summary comments in the Feedback comments column for each student. Leave the other data untouched unless you know exactly what you\\'re doing. Repeat as needed. Save the csv file.\\nNote: Take care to enter data in the correct column of the spreadsheet.\\nIf you are annotating the submissions to return to students as feedback:\\nOpen a downloaded submission. Carry out your annotations. Save it in its original place i.e. the folder corresponding to that student. Repeat as needed.\\nIf you have separate feedback files to upload to students:\\nSave these within that student\\'s folder. You can give students multiple feedback files in this way e.g. annotations on their work along with a separate pro forma.\\nNote: Don\\'t change the name or location of the folder - Moodle needs this information to allocate the files correctly.\\nCompress (zip) all the feedback files:\\nLocate the folder containing the feedback files in Moodle, select them all (Ctrl+A within the folder), then zip them: Windows: Right click one of the selected files and Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder. Mac: Right Click (or Ctrl+click) one of the selected files and click Compress. They are now ready for upload (see below).\\nWindows: Right click one of the selected files and Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder.

Click Continue \\ufeff. From the page containing the Grading Table, you can check your feedback files by enabling Quick grading (see Options at the bottom of that page) and scrolling horizontally, if needed.\\nFor an assignment with no file submissions, see the discussion upload feedback files without student file submissions for details of what to do.\\nIf you have high level feedback you want to give to an entire cohort, it is generally a good idea to give this feedback in the context of the assignment, rather than e.g. separately via a Forum. Moodle allows you to select some or all students and attach a single, common feedback file to their assignment feedback. This common feedback will appear to each student along with any other individual feedback files you have prepared for each.\\nPrepare the single file of feedback. Click on the link to the Assignment; its summary page displays. Click View all submissions ; the assignment\\'s Grading Table displays. Use the checkboxes to select all or some students to receive the feedback (you may first prefer to configure the Grading Table to show as many students as possible on a single page).

This method of marking is used mainly with the vocational criteria assessed assignments as found in secondary and further education in the UK. The classic example is the BTEC qualifications from the Edexcel exam board. A teacher enters a comment per pre-defined criteria and indicates if the student has met the criteria or not. There is no concept of percentages, numbers or letters. Criteria are either met or not met. An assignment can have criteria at Pass, Merit and Distinction level and any combination of those levels (referred to for short as P, M and D). For example, an assignment might have P1, M1, D1, or only P1 or P1, P2 and D1. If a student fails to get all P criteria they get an overall Refer for the assignment.

Development was started by Martin Dougiamas who continues to lead the project.\\n\" I\\'ve been working on it, in some way or other, for a long time. It started in the 90\\'s when I was webmaster at Curtin University of Technology and a system administrator of their WebCT installation. I encountered many frustrations with the WebCT beast and developed an itch that needed scratching - there had to be a better way (no, not Blackboard\\xa0:-) \" I also know a lot of people in schools and smaller institutions (and some big ones!) who want to make better use of the Internet but don\\'t know where to start in the maze of technologies and pedagogies that are out there. I\\'ve always hoped there would be a Free alternative that such people could use to help them move their teaching skills into the online environment. \" My strong beliefs in the unrealised possibilities of Internet-based education led me to complete a Masters and then a PhD in Education, combining my former career in Computer Science with newly constructed knowledge about the nature of learning and collaboration. In particular, I am particularly influenced by the epistemology of social constructionism - which not only treats learning as a social activity, but focusses attention on the learning that occurs while actively constructing artifacts (such as texts) for others to see or use. It is crucial to me that this software be easy to use - in fact it should be as intuitive as possible. \" I\\'m committed to continuing my work on Moodle and on keeping it Open and Free. I have a deeply-held belief in the importance of unrestricted education and empowered teaching, and Moodle is the main way I can contribute to the realisation of these ideals.\" - Martin Dougiamas\\nA number of early prototypes were produced and discarded before he released version 1.0 upon a largely unsuspecting world on August 20, 2002. This version was targeted towards smaller, more intimate classes at University level, and was the subject of research case studies that closely analysed the nature of collaboration and reflection that occurred among these small groups of adult participants.\\nSince then there has been steady series of new releases adding new features, better scalability and improved performance.\\nAs Moodle has spread and the community has grown, more input is being drawn from a wider variety of people in different teaching situations. For example, Moodle is now used not only in Universities, but in high schools, primary schools, non-profit organisations, private companies, by independent teachers and even homeschooling parents. A growing number of people from around the world are contributing to Moodle in different ways - for more details see the Credits page.\\nAn important feature of the Moodle project is moodle.org , which provides a central point for information, discussion and collaboration among Moodle users, who include system administrators, teachers, researchers, instructional designers and of course, developers. Like Moodle, this site is always evolving to suit the needs of the community, and like Moodle it will always be Free.\\nIn 2003, the company moodle.com was launched to provide additional commercial support for those who need it, as well as managed hosting, consulting and other services.  This has now expanded in the Moodle Certified Partners and Service Providers network of over 40 companies world-wide.\\nFor more about our future plans for Moodle, see the Future roadmap.\\n'}]},\n",

If you need to make changes for your specific install, please let me know, so I can look into making it into a preference item (also take a look at the todo list below).\\nINSTALLATION\\n1. Copy enrol/lmb into the enrol/ directory on your Moodle server.\\n2. Copy lang/en_utf8/enrol_lmb.php into the lang/en_utf8/ directory on your Moodle server.\\n3. Copy lang/en_utf8/help/enrol/lmb into the lang/en_utf8/help/enrol/ directory on your Moodle server.\\n4. You should secure enrol/lmb/secure/ with a username/password using .htaccess.\\n5. Login to your Moodle server as an admin user, and visit the 'Notifications' page. Moodle will automatically setup the tables for this module.\\n6. Under Course->Enrolments edit the settings for Luminis Message Broker.\\nNOTE: You must save the setting at least once, even if you don't make any changes, before you use this module. This is a bug that will be fixed later.\\nLMB\\n---\\nYou can configure, through the Luminis Message Broker interface, the LMB module to be a HTTP consumer. You should point it to enrol/lmb/secure/liveimport.php on your Moodle server, and enter the HTTP username and password you setup previously. You should only use SSL (HTTPS) to ensure security of the interface.\\nUSAGE\\nWhen used with the Luminis Message Broker, you will generally import a complete XML from banner before the start of a term/semester, and the Luminis Message Broker will continuously send messages that will keep Moodle up-to-date throughout the term.\\nIf you are using this module without Luminis Message Broker, you can configure the module to import a full XML file on a regular basis. To do this, call importnow.php from a script or cron, much in the same way that the Moodle cron is polled.\\nYou should disable users from being able to change the course and user idnumber fields, these are used to reference courses. This may change in the future.\\nWhen doing mass imports, terms should come before courses and then crosslisted courses, users should come before enrolments (which need to come courses and crosslistsing). There are tools in work that will make this order less important.\\nMULTI-FILE EXTRACTS\\nPlace a directory at the XML Folder path that you have specified in the settings. In this folder, place any XML files to be processed (must end in .xml), as well as an empty file called 'start'. The 'start' file and directory must be writable by the webserver.\\nWhen this is complete, you call extractprocess.php to preform the extract.\\nWhen the processing starts, the module will remove the file 'start', and create a file called 'processing'. After extract processing has completed, the 'processing' will be removed, and a 'done' file created. These status files allow people/scripts to check the state of the run. It is important that the XML files are not modified/replaced while the extract is processing, or inconsistent results may occur. Should a problem occur during extract, such as the processor dies, or the XML files are inadvertently modified/removed, it is safe to re-process the extract with a consistent set of XML.\\nIn the event an incomplete XML set is processed, students/instructors may be inadvertently removed from their courses. Re-processing with a complete XML set will reinstate users into their courses and no data is lost.\\n\"}]},\n",

The changes that need be made are the same in all versions of Moodle, just in different OS\\' they need be made in different places. Upload file sizes are restricted in a number of ways and each one in this list restricts the following ones:\\nPerhaps the best place to find this information is at File upload size There is a full explanation for a number of different OSs but there are a few missing.\\nThis is a contentious issue, mainly because you might think that it should be set inside the Moodle. Unfortunately, this is not so, these are environment issues that need to be set in the server and PHP folders, Moodle cannot work outside itself.\\nBefore doing this, consult with your host, they may have very different ideas about what your Moodle should be permitted - try not to tread on their toes - they may get annoyed at you breaching your user conditions. In an Apache server, you can create a file called .htaccess which can allow you to override some of the limitations set by PHP on your Moodle. Be aware that this file only applies to your Moodle, and nothing else. Your host will often place a .htaccess file into your root folder which will usually read something like:\\nThese are security related, so there is no need to delete them or otherwise edit them. To overwrite set values in the hosts php.ini file, you may want to use:\\nTo overwrite boolean or logical settings use:\\nor\\nSomething similar can be done in IIS, but it is a lot more complex.\\nThanks Muano\\nYes, you can. In fact there is very little that has changed in the changing version. Not that the TeX filter has not be changed, it certainly has, but it does not affect how you will use TeX Notation . It is supposed to be easier to add a third party plugin for TeX, but the relationship between Moodle and such tools as MathJax or Geogebra, or similar tools, is still to be determined.\\nMoodle 2 has done things very differently here. Logos and other images are all controlled by the theme. Each theme folder is constructed the same way so it makes it easy to edit. Native Moodle themes use the moodle/pix folder to store common images. Look in there to find the logo for any native theme and that can be replaced by a new logo. Third party themes often use the moodle/theme/pix folder to store images, including logos.\\nGo and look at the theme folder and in it you will find the name of the theme you are using. In it you will also find the sub-folders for different elements and you should find your layout folder contains most of the instructions for controlling the layout, the Styles folder controls the appearance and so on. Images used in the theme can all be located there as well, in the pix folder.\\nIf you want to use a theme that does not have an image or a logo, just the default icons, then you are talking a serious revamp. For that, you need to look at the Themes 2.0 page.\\nIn some ways, Moodle 2 has made it easier to setup a front page the way you want it. Different themes will use different defaults, many moving away from the traditional three collumn, blocks, categories/courses, blocks, structure that pervaded Moodle 1.9. The Moodle 2 documentation has a more complete look at the Front page settings than can be viewed here. Also, for a better overview of how this can all be done at a site level, look at the Customising appearance pages.\\nThere are a couple of causes for this problem, but the main one seems to be we forget the jumble of passwords we are required to remember. There are also a number of ways of getting around it, as well.\\nThis discussion covers just about all of them. There are a couple of scripts so be careful and use the right one if you need to.\\nIf you do not wish to use a script, then you can try this: \\nUsing phpMyAdmin, enter the database and look for the mdl_users table. The first line of that table\\'s data should be the Guest, and the password for Guest is \"guest\", without the quote marks. Copy that password and then look for your identity. Paste the \"guest\" password over the top of yours when you locate it. You should be able to access your Moodle as an Admin.\\nIt has been reported this does not work in every circumstance, but most. To get around that problem you might want to try commenting out the line\\nThat should then work.\\nIf you really want to get original files from the backup file (an \".mbz\" file) you downloaded (using the backup and restore feature), here it goes...\\nThe backup file can actually be opened with any zip/unzip program you can download. Once you open the file, you need to extract:\\nNext step would be to open the \"files.xml\" file in a text editor, and:\\nFor example, let\\'s assume there is a \"backup_courses-120730.mbz\" file of which the \"files.xml\" file and the \"files\" folder have been extracted. There is a PDF file named \"Leadership.pdf\" that is required for another purpose.\\nOpen the files.xml file and:\\n1. Search for the string \"Leadership.pdf\", which in this case is found under the following <file id...> group tag:\\n2. Take note of the corresponding contenthash value: fb6cf43a9b2d432403c70a2cb4c340dbb6225631.\\n3. As the first two characters of the contenthash are \"fb\", open the \"fb\" folder inside the \"files\" directory (which was previously extracted), and there is a file named \"fb6cf43a9b...\". Rename that file as \"Leadership.pdf\", and then move it to another location. Repeat this for all the files required, using the correct contenthash value of course.\\nThanks to Guillermo Madero S for this answer.\\nThere is always a number of reasons why you may require several different versions of Moodle on your server, or your localhost on a standalone computer. You may want to run two completely different Moodles for different purposes, so they may be the same versions. The answers are the same for all of them, and you may want to use different techniques depending on your circumstances.\\nFirst, in all versions of Moodle you are able to set the cookie prefix. Whenever you install a Moodle, it is a good idea to not just accept the default for the cookie prefix. Go to Administration menu > Server > Session Handling and you will see there is a text box that allows you to add a prefix for the Moodle. If you do this for every installation, you can have any number of installations - the problem is going to be the database.\\nAt installation, you can create two different databases. again in some circumstances, there may be any number of valid reasons to do this, but fact is, you may not, in v2.x have to worry about it too much. Each installation will generate its own tables so, at installation, you may not have to worry too much apart from giving the databases different names.\\nLook at Site administration ► Plugins ► Authentication ► Manage authentication and there is a switch there that allows you to turn the Guest Access button off altogether.\\n'},\n",

Apparent answer: YES. Personally, I found this very counter-intuitive, as \"importing a course\" or \"restore from backup\" or other similar administrative tasks seem to me to be on a level outside a specific course.  For example, having the \"Restore\" feature only available in the admin tools for a particular course makes it seem like the restoration will only work for that course—but that is not true.  You can use any course\\'s \"Restore\" link in the admin tools and choose \"Create a New Course\" mid-way through the retoration procedure. But creating a new course from backup that has nothing to do with the course in which one has clicked the \"Restore\" link is, like I said, counter-intuitive. And, to top it off, I could find no mention of this until I had already clicked on \"Restore\". Looks like I need to add some information to the \"administrative tools\" or \"backup/restore\" docs, hm?\\xa0:) Is there a specific \"Bb-to-Moodle\" conversion tool? Answer: NO. Unlike the WebCT-to-Moodle conversion, which requires a specific add-on , Bb conversion is now built in. What format does the Bb export have to be in? The Bb \"export\" should be an archive of the Bb course, rather than an export; otherwise you can\\'t restore the course because it is missing a name (and possibly other fields). What versions of Bb and Moodle will this work for? There is a tool floating around called \" Blackboard Content Conversion Tool (CCT) \" that sounds useful for converting Bb to Moodle. Do I need it? Answer: NO.  Actually, I had a bunch of questions about that tool, too, but ultimately I did not need it. Does the CCT run on the server where Bb is running? Does it interact, somehow, directly with the Bb instance? Or does it run on the Moodle server and do the import from Bb into Moodle?\\nApparent answer: YES.

It applies to the 1.5 development version of Moodle (and any newer) only , as the blocks subsystem was rewritten and expanded for the 1.5 release. However, you can also find it useful if you want to modify blocks written for Moodle 1.3 and 1.4 to work with the latest versions (look at Appendix B ).\\nThe guide is written as an interactive course which aims to develop a configurable, multi-purpose block that displays arbitrary HTML. It's targeted mainly at people with little experience with Moodle or programming in general and aims to show how easy it is to create new blocks for Moodle. A certain small amount of PHP programming knowledge is still required, though.\\nExperienced developers and those who just want a reference text should refer to Appendix A because the main guide has a rather low concentration of pure information in the text.\\n\"},\n",

       "    'text': 'To define a \"block\" in Moodle, in the most basic case we need to provide just one source code file. We start by creating the directory /blocks/simplehtml/ and creating a file named /blocks/simplehtml/ block_simplehtml.php which will hold our code. We then begin coding the block:\\n<?php\\nclass block_simplehtml extends block_base {\\n\\nThe first line is our block class definition; it must be named exactly in the manner shown. Again, only the \"simplehtml\" part can (and indeed must) change; everything else is standardized.\\nOur class is then given a small method: init() . This is essential for all blocks, and its purpose is to set the two class member variables listed inside it. But what do these values actually mean? Here\\'s a more detailed description.\\n$this->title is the title displayed in the header of our block. We can set it to whatever we like; in this case it\\'s set to read the actual title from a language file we are presumably distributing together with the block. I \\'ll skip ahead a bit here and say that if you want your block to display no title at all, then you should set this to any descriptive value you want (but not make it an empty string). We will later see how to disable the title\\'s display .\\n$this->version is the version of our block. This actually would only make a difference if your block wanted to keep its own data in special tables in the database (i.e. for very complex blocks). In that case the version number is used exactly as it\\'s used in activities; an upgrade script uses it to incrementally upgrade an \"old\" version of the block\\'s data to the latest. We will outline this process further ahead, since blocks tend to be relatively simple and not hold their own private data.\\nIn our example, this is certainly the case so we just set $this->version to YYYYMMDD00 and forget about it.\\nUPDATING: Prior to version 1.5, the basic structure of each block class was slightly different. Refer to Appendix B for more information on the changes that old blocks have to make to conform to the new standard.\\nTemplate:Moodle 2.0\\nIf you are using Moodle 2.0 and starting to develop your own block. You have to put the version information of the block in a separate file named version.php in /blocks/simplehtml/ version.php . This file has no reference in its name or content to the block\\'s name (simplehtml).\\nMoodle 2.0 will also require a name for your plugin to show in the upgrading page. You set this value in a language package (the same file where you put your string for the plugin title). Create the file /blocks/simplehtml/lang/en/ block_simplehtml.php and paste the following code:\\n<?php\\n\\n'},\n",

The new code is:\\n\\n}   // Here\\'s the closing curly bracket for the class definition\\n?>\\nIt can\\'t get any simpler than that, can it? Let\\'s dissect this method to see what\\'s going on...\\nFirst of all, there is a check that returns the current value of $this->content if it\\'s not NULL; otherwise we proceed with \"computing\" it. Since the computation is potentially a time-consuming operation and it will be called several times for each block (Moodle works that way internally), we take a precaution and include this time-saver.\\nSupposing the content had not been computed before (it was NULL), we then define it from scratch. The code speaks for itself there, so there isn\\'t much to say. Just keep in mind that we can use HTML both in the text and in the footer, if we want to.\\nAt this point our block should be capable of being automatically installed in Moodle and added to courses; visit your administration page to install it (Click \"Notifications\" under the Site Administration Block) and after seeing it in action come back to continue our tutorial.\\n'},\n",

       "    'text': 'The current version of our block doesn\\'t really do much; it just displays a fixed message, which is not very useful. What we \\'d really like to do is allow the teachers to customize what goes into the block. This, in block-speak, is called \"instance configuration\". So let\\'s give our block some instance configuration...\\nFirst of all, we need to tell Moodle that we want it to provide instance-specific configuration amenities to our block. That\\'s as simple as adding one more method to our block class:\\nfunction instance_allow_config() {\\n}\\nThis small change is enough to make Moodle display an \"Edit...\" icon in our block\\'s header when we turn editing mode on in any course. However, if you try to click on that icon you will be presented with a notice that complains about the block\\'s configuration not being implemented correctly. Try it, it\\'s harmless.\\nMoodle\\'s complaints do make sense. We told it that we want to have configuration, but we didn\\'t say what kind of configuration we want, or how it should be displayed. To do that, we need to create one more file: /blocks/simplehtml/ config_instance.html (which has to be named exactly like that). For the moment, copy paste the following into it and save:\\n\\n<?php use_html_editor();\\xa0?>\\nIt isn\\'t difficult to see that the above code just provides us with a wysiwyg-editor-enabled textarea to write our block\\'s desired content in and a submit button to save. But... what\\'s $this->config->text? Well...\\nMoodle goes a long way to make things easier for block developers. Did you notice that the textarea is actually named \"text\"? When the submit button is pressed, Moodle saves each and every field it can find in our config_instance.html file as instance configuration data.\\nWe can then access that data as $this->config-> variablename , where variablename is the actual name we used for our field; in this case, \"text\". So in essence, the above form just pre-populates the textarea with the current content of the block (as indeed it should) and then allows us to change it.\\nYou also might be surprised by the presence of a submit button and the absence of any <form> element at the same time. But the truth is, we don\\'t need to worry about that at all; Moodle goes a really long way to make things easier for developers! We just print the configuration options we want, in any format we want; include a submit button, and Moodle will handle all the rest itself. The instance configuration variables are automatically at our disposal to access from any of the class methods except init() .\\nIn the event where the default behaviour is not satisfactory, we can still override it. However, this requires advanced modifications to our block class and will not be covered here; refer to Appendix A for more details.\\nHaving now the ability to refer to this instance configuration data through $this->config , the final twist is to tell our block to actually display what is saved in its configuration data. To do that, find this snippet in /blocks/simplehtml/block_simplehtml.php :\\n\\n\\nand change it to:\\n\\n\\nOh, and since the footer isn\\'t really exciting at this point, we remove it from our block because it doesn\\'t contribute anything. We could just as easily have decided to make the footer configurable in the above way, too. So for our latest code, the snippet becomes:\\n\\n\\nAfter this discussion, our block is ready for prime time! Indeed, if you now visit any course with a SimpleHTML block, you will see that modifying its contents is now a snap.\\nTemplate:Moodle 2.0\\nIn Moodle 2.0 there is a simpler way to create the interface to configure your block. Instead of creating the /blocks/simplehtml/ config_instance.html file, you have to create a /blocks/simplehtml/ edit_form.php file which contains only php code and no HTML. Moodle will process this file and add its elements to the configuration page for your block.\\nCreate the edit_form.php file and paste the following code: <?php\\nclass block_simplehtml_edit_form extends block_edit_form {\\n} The first line declares a class that inherits from block_edit_form, this allows Moodle to identify the code to execute in the configuration page. The specific_definition function does two things: It indicates the header for the configuration section, which in this case we took from the \\'blocksettings\\' string for blocks. The second part is where you define the variables that will be defined in the config part of your block. Three lines define this: The first one adds an element, each element is a variable within config, that is of text type, and is described by the blockstring string in the language file for the simplehtml block. The second line indicates a default value (in case it is not yet defined). The third line sets a type for our variable, in this case PARAM_MULTILANG. Template:Top\\n'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Implementing instance configuration for the block\\'s contents was good enough to whet our appetite, but who wants to stop there? Why not customize the block\\'s title, too?\\nWhy not, indeed. Well, our first attempt to achieve this is natural enough: let\\'s add another field to /blocks/simplehtml/config_instance.html . Here goes:\\n\\n<?php print_string(\\'configtitle\\', \\'block_simplehtml\\');\\xa0?>:\\nWe save the edited file, go to a course, edit the title of the block and... nothing happens! The instance configuration is saved correctly, all right (editing it once more proves that) but it\\'s not being displayed. All we get is just the simple \"SimpleHTML\" title.\\n\\nThat\\'s not too weird, if we think back a bit. Do you remember that init() method, where we set $this->title ? We didn\\'t actually change its value from then, and $this->title is definitely not the same as $this->config->title (to Moodle, at least). What we need is a way to update $this->title with the value in the instance configuration. But as we said a bit earlier, we can use $this->config in all methods except init() ! So what can we do?\\n\\nLet\\'s pull out another ace from our sleeve, and add this small method to our block class: function specialization() {\\n  if (!empty($this->config->title)) {\\n    $this->title = $this->config->title;\\n  } else {\\n    $this->config->title = \\'Some title ...\\';\\n  }\\n  if (empty($this->config->text)) {\\n    $this->config->text = \\'Some text ...\\';\\n  }    \\n} Aha, here\\'s what we wanted to do all along! But what\\'s going on with the specialization() method?\\n\\nThis \"magic\" method has actually a very nice property: it\\'s guaranteed to be automatically called by Moodle as soon as our instance configuration is loaded and available (that is, immediately after init() is called). That means before the block\\'s content is computed for the first time, and indeed before anything else is done with the block. Thus, providing a specialization() method is the natural choice for any configuration data that needs to be acted upon \"as soon as possible\", as in this case.\\n'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Now would be a good time to mention another nifty technique that can be used in blocks, and which comes in handy quite often. Specifically, it may be the case that our block will have something interesting to display some of the time; but in some other cases, it won\\'t have anything useful to say. (An example here would be the \"Recent Activity\" block, in the case where no recent activity in fact exists.\\nHowever in that case the block chooses to explicitly inform you of the lack of said activity, which is arguably useful). It would be nice, then, to be able to have our block \"disappear\" if it\\'s not needed to display it.\\nThis is indeed possible, and the way to do it is to make sure that after the get_content() method is called, the block is completely void of content. Specifically, \"void of content\" means that both $this->content->text and $this->content->footer are each equal to the empty string (\\'\\'). Moodle performs this check by calling the block\\'s is_empty() method, and if the block is indeed empty then it is not displayed at all.\\nNote that the exact value of the block\\'s title and the presence or absence of a hide_header() method do not affect this behavior. A block is considered empty if it has no content, irrespective of anything else.\\n'},\n",

It would be really nice to be able to add multiple blocks of this type to a single course. And, as you might have guessed, doing that is as simple as adding another small method to our block class:\\nfunction instance_allow_multiple() {\\n}\\nThis tells Moodle that it should allow any number of instances of the SimpleHTML block in any course. After saving the changes to our file, Moodle immediately allows us to add multiple copies of the block without further ado!\\nThere are a couple more of interesting points to note here. First of all, even if a block itself allows multiple instances in the same page, the administrator still has the option of disallowing such behavior. This setting can be set separately for each block from the Administration / Configuration / Blocks page.\\nAnd finally, a nice detail is that as soon as we defined an instance_allow_multiple() method, the method instance_allow_config() that was already defined became obsolete.\\nMoodle assumes that if a block allows multiple instances of itself, those instances will want to be configured (what is the point of same multiple instances in the same page if they are identical?) and thus automatically provides an \"Edit\" icon. So, we can also remove the whole instance_allow_config() method now without harm. We had only needed it when multiple instances of the block were not allowed.\\nTemplate:Top\\n'},\n",
       "   {'header2_name': 'The Effects of Globalization',\n",
       "    'text': 'Configuring each block instance with its own personal data is cool enough, but sometimes administrators need some way to \"touch\" all instances of a specific block at the same time. In the case of our SimpleHTML block, a few settings that would make sense to apply to all instances aren\\'t that hard to come up with.\\nFor example, we might want to limit the contents of each block to only so many characters, or we might have a setting that filters HTML out of the block\\'s contents, only allowing pure text in. Granted, such a feature wouldn\\'t win us any awards for naming our block \"SimpleHTML\" but some tormented administrator somewhere might actually find it useful.\\nThis kind of configuration is called \"global configuration\" and applies only to a specific block type (all instances of that block type are affected, however). Implementing such configuration for our block is quite similar to implementing the instance configuration. We will now see how to implement the second example, having a setting that only allows text and not HTML in the block\\'s contents.\\nFirst of all, we need to tell Moodle that we want our block to provide global configuration by, what a surprise, adding a small method to our block class:\\nfunction has_config() {\\n}\\nThen, we need to create a HTML file that actually prints out the configuration screen. In our case, we \\'ll just print out a checkbox saying \"Do not allow HTML in the content\" and a \"submit\" button. Let\\'s create the file /blocks/simplehtml/config_global.html which again must be named just so, and copy paste the following into it:\\nTODO: New settings.php method\\n\\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"block_simplehtml_strict\" value=\"0\" />\\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"block_simplehtml_strict\" value=\"1\"\\n  <?php if(!empty($CFG->block_simplehtml_strict)) \\n            echo \\'checked=\"checked\"\\';\\xa0?> />\\n  <?php print_string(\\'donotallowhtml\\', \\'block_simplehtml\\');\\xa0?> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"<?php print_string(\\'savechanges\\');\\xa0?>\" />\\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"<?php print_string(\\'savechanges\\');\\xa0?>\" />\\n\\nTrue to our block\\'s name, this looks simple enough. What it does is that it displays a checkbox named \"block_simplehtml_strict\" and if the Moodle configuration variable with the same name (i.e., $CFG->block_simplehtml_strict) is set and not empty (that means it\\'s not equal to an empty string, to zero, or to boolean FALSE) it displays the box as pre-checked (reflecting the current status).\\nWhy does it check the configuration setting with the same name? Because the default implementation of the global configuration saving code takes all the variables we have in our form and saves them as Moodle configuration options with the same name. Thus, it\\'s good practice to use a descriptive name and also one that won\\'t possibly conflict with the name of another setting.\\n\"block_simplehtml_strict\" clearly satisfies both requirements.\\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we actually have two input fields named \"block_simplehtml_strict\" in our configuration file. One is hidden and its value is always 0; the other is the checkbox and its value is 1. What gives? Why have them both there?\\nActually, this is a small trick we use to make our job as simple as possible. HTML forms work this way: if a checkbox in a form is not checked, its name does not appear at all in the variables passed to PHP when the form is submitted. That effectively means that, when we uncheck the box and click submit, the variable is not passed to PHP at all. Thus, PHP does not know to update its value to \"0\", and our \"strict\" setting cannot be turned off at all once we turn it on for the first time. Not the behavior we want, surely.\\nHowever, when PHP handles received variables from a form, the variables are processed in the order in which they appear in the form. If a variable comes up having the same name with an already-processed variable, the new value overwrites the old one. Taking advantage of this, our logic runs as follows: the variable \"block_simplehtml_strict\" is first unconditionally set to \"0\". Then, if the box is checked, it is set to \"1\", overwriting the previous value as discussed. The net result is that our configuration setting behaves as it should.\\nTo round our bag of tricks up, notice that the use of if(!empty($CFG->block_simplehtml_strict)) in the test for \"should the box be checked by default?\" is quite deliberate. The first time this script runs, the variable $CFG->block_simplehtml_strict will not exist at all. After it\\'s set for the first time, its value can be either \"0\" or \"1\". Given that both \"not set\" and the string \"0\" evaluate as empty while the sting \"1\" does not, we manage to avoid any warnings from PHP regarding the variable not being set at all, and have a nice human-readable representation for its two possible values (\"0\" and \"1\").\\nNow that we have managed to cram a respectable amount of tricks into a few lines of HTML, we might as well discuss the alternative in case that tricks are not enough for a specific configuration setup we have in mind. Saving the data is done in the method config_save() , the default implementation of which is as follows:\\nfunction config_save($data) {\\n}\\nAs can be clearly seen, Moodle passes this method an associative array $data which contains all the variables coming in from our configuration screen. If we wanted to do the job without the \"hidden variable with the same name\" trick we used above, one way to do it would be by overriding this method with the following:\\nfunction config_save($data) {\\n}\\nQuite straightfoward: if the variable \"block_simplehtml_strict\" is passed to us, then it can only mean that the user has checked it, so set the configuration variable with the same name to \"1\". Otherwise, set it to \"0\". Of course, this version would need to be updated if we add more configuration options because it doesn\\'t respond to them as the default implementation does. Still, it\\'s useful to know how we can override the default implementation if it does not fit our needs (for example, we might not want to save the variable as part of the Moodle configuration but do something else with it).\\nSo, we are now at the point where we know if the block should allow HTML tags in its content or not. How do we get the block to actually respect that setting?\\nWe could decide to do one of two things: either have the block \"clean\" HTML out from the input before saving it in the instance configuration and then display it as-is (the \"eager\" approach); or have it save the data \"as is\" and then clean it up each time just before displaying it (the \"lazy\" approach). The eager approach involves doing work once when saving the configuration; the lazy approach means doing work each time the block is displayed and thus it promises to be worse performance-wise. We shall hence go with the eager approach.\\nNow that we have a working config_global with saved values we want to be able to read the values from it. The simplest way to do this is to assign the config setting to a string and then use the string as we would any other. IE;\\n$string = $CFG->configsetting;\\nYou can check all the configuration settings available to a module by displaying them all with;\\nprint_object($CFG);\\nTemplate:Top\\nMuch as we did just before with overriding config_save() , what is needed here is overriding the method instance_config_save() which handles the instance configuration. The default implementation is as follows:\\nfunction instance_config_save($data) {\\n}\\nThis may look intimidating at first (what\\'s all this stripslashes_recursive() and base64_encode() and serialize() stuff?) but do not despair; we won\\'t have to touch any of it. We will only add some extra validation code in the beginning and then instruct Moodle to additionally call this default implementation to do the actual storing of the data. Specifically, we will add a method to our class which goes like this:\\nfunction instance_config_save($data) {\\n}\\nAt last! Now the administrator has absolute power of life and death over what type of content is allowed in our \"SimpleHTML\" block! Absolute? Well... not exactly. In fact, if we think about it for a while, it will become apparent that if at some point in time HTML is allowed and some blocks have saved their content with HTML included, and afterwards the administrator changes the setting to \"off\", this will only prevent subsequent content changes from including HTML. Blocks which already had HTML in their content would continue to display it!\\nFollowing that train of thought, the next stop is realizing that we wouldn\\'t have this problem if we had chosen the lazy approach a while back, because in that case we would \"sanitize\" each block\\'s content just before it was displayed.\\nThe only thing we can do with the eager approach is strip all the tags from the content of all SimpleHTML instances as soon as the admin setting is changed to \"HTML off\"; but even then, turning the setting back to \"HTML on\" won\\'t bring back the tags we stripped away. On the other hand, the lazy approach might be slower, but it\\'s more versatile; we can choose whether to strip or keep the HTML before displaying the content, and we won\\'t lose it at all if the admin toggles the setting off and on again. Isn\\'t the life of a developer simple and wonderful?\\nWe will let this part of the tutorial come to a close with the obligatory exercise for the reader: \\nIn order to have the SimpleHTML block work \"correctly\", find out how to strengthen the eager approach to strip out all tags from the existing configuration of all instances of our block, or go back and implement the lazy approach instead. \\n(Hint: Do that in the get_content() method.)\\nPrior to version 1.5, the file config_global.html was named simply config.html . Also, the methods config_save and config_print were named handle_config and print_config respectively. Upgrading a block to work with Moodle 1.5 involves updating these aspects; refer to Appendix B for more information.\\n'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Our block is just about complete functionally, so now let\\'s take a look at some of the tricks we can use to make its behavior customized in a few more useful ways.\\nFirst of all, there are a couple of ways we can adjust the visual aspects of our block. For starters, it might be useful to create a block that doesn\\'t display a header (title) at all. You can see this effect in action in the Course Description block that comes with Moodle. This behavior is achieved by, you guessed it, adding one more method to our block class:\\nfunction hide_header() {\\n}\\nOne more note here: we cannot just set an empty title inside the block\\'s init() method; it\\'s necessary for each block to have a unique, non-empty title after init() is called so that Moodle can use those titles to differentiate between all of the installed blocks.\\nAnother adjustment we might want to do is instruct our block to take up a certain amount of width on screen. Moodle handles this as a two-part process: first, it queries each block about its preferred width and takes the maximum number as the desired value. Then, the page that\\'s being displayed can choose to use this value or, more probably, bring it within some specific range of values if it isn\\'t already. That means that the width setting is a best-effort settlement; your block can request a certain width and Moodle will try to provide it, but there\\'s no guarantee whatsoever about the end result. As a concrete example, all standard Moodle course formats will deliver any requested width between 180 and 210 pixels, inclusive.\\nTo instruct Moodle about our block\\'s preferred width, we add one more method to the block class:\\nfunction preferred_width() {\\n}\\nThis will make our block (and all the other blocks displayed at the same side of the page) a bit wider than standard.\\nFinally, we can also affect some properties of the actual HTML that will be used to print our block. Each block is fully contained within a <div> or <table> elements, inside which all the HTML for that block is printed. We can instruct Moodle to add HTML attributes with specific values to that container. This would be done to either a) directly affect the end result (if we say, assign bgcolor=\"black\"), or b) give us freedom to customize the end result using CSS (this is in fact done by default as we\\'ll see below).\\nThe default behavior of this feature in our case will assign to our block\\'s container the class HTML attribute with the value \"sideblock block_simplehtml\" (the prefix \"block_\" followed by the name of our block, lowercased). We can then use that class to make CSS selectors in our theme to alter this block\\'s visual style (for example, \".sideblock.block_simplehtml { border: 1px black solid}\").\\nTo change the default behavior, we will need to define a method which returns an associative array of attribute names and values. For example, the version\\nfunction html_attributes() {\\n}\\nwill result in a mouseover event being added to our block using JavaScript, just as if we had written the onmouseover=\"alert(...)\" part ourselves in HTML. Note that we actually duplicate the part which sets the class attribute (we want to keep that, and since we override the default behavior it\\'s our responsibility to emulate it if required).\\nAnd the final elegant touch is that we don\\'t set the class to the hard-coded value \"block_simplehtml\" but instead use the name() method to make it dynamically match our block\\'s name.\\nfunction html_attributes() {\\n}\\nThis method should return an associative array of HTML attributes that will be given to your block\\'s container element when Moodle constructs the output HTML. No sanitization will be performed in these elements at all.\\nIf you intend to override this method, you should return the default attributes as well as those you add yourself. The recommended way to do this is:\\nfunction html_attributes() {\\n}\\n'},\n",

       "    'text': 'It\\'s not difficult to imagine a block which is very useful in some circumstances but it simply cannot be made meaningful in others. An example of this would be the \"Social Activities\" block which is indeed useful in a course with the social format, but doesn\\'t do anything useful in a course with the weeks format. There should be some way of allowing the use of such blocks only where they are indeed meaningful, and not letting them confuse users if they are not.\\nMoodle allows us to declare which course formats each block is allowed to be displayed in, and enforces these restrictions as set by the block developers at all times. The information is given to Moodle as a standard associative array, with each key corresponding to a page format and defining a boolean value (true/false) that declares whether the block should be allowed to appear in that page format.\\nNotice the deliberate use of the term page instead of course in the above paragraph. This is because in Moodle 1.5 and onwards, blocks can be displayed in any page that supports them. The best example of such pages are the course pages, but we are not restricted to them. For instance, the quiz view page (the first one we see when we click on the name of the quiz) also supports blocks.\\nThe format names we can use for the pages derive from the name of the script which is actually used to display that page. For example, when we are looking at a course, the script is /course/view.php (this is evident from the browser\\'s address line). Thus, the format name of that page is course-view . It follows easily that the format name for a quiz view page is mod-quiz-view . This rule of thumb does have a few exceptions, however:\\nThe format name for the front page of Moodle is site-index . The format name for courses is actually not just course-view ; it is course-view-weeks , course-view-topics , etc. Even though there is no such page, the format name all can be used as a catch-all option.\\nWe can include as many format names as we want in our definition of the applicable formats. Each format can be allowed or disallowed, and there are also three more rules that help resolve the question \"is this block allowed into this page or not?\":\\nPrefixes of a format name will match that format name; for example, mod will match all the activity modules. course-view will match any course, regardless of the course format. And finally, site will also match the front page (remember that its full format name is site-index ). The more specialized a format name that matches our page is, the higher precedence it has when deciding if the block will be allowed. For example, mod , mod-quiz and mod-quiz-view all match the quiz view page. But if all three are present, mod-quiz-view will take precedence over the other two because it is a better match. The character * can be used in place of any word. For example, mod and mod-* are equivalent. At the time of this document\\'s writing, there is no actual reason to utilize this \"wildcard matching\" feature, but it exists for future usage. The order that the format names appear does not make any difference.\\nAll of the above are enough to make the situation sound complex, so let\\'s look at some specific examples. First of all, to have our block appear only in the site front page, we would use:\\nfunction applicable_formats() {\\n}\\nSince all is missing, the block is disallowed from appearing in any course format; but then site is set to TRUE, so it\\'s explicitly allowed to appear in the site front page (remember that site matches site-index because it\\'s a prefix).\\nFor another example, if we wanted to allow the block to appear in all course formats except social, and also to not be allowed anywhere but in courses, we would use:\\nfunction applicable_formats() {\\n}\\nThis time, we first allow the block to appear in all courses and then we explicitly disallow the social format.\\nFor our final, most complicated example, suppose that a block can be displayed in the site front page, in courses (but not social courses) and also when we are viewing any activity module, except quiz. This would be:\\nfunction applicable_formats() {\\n}\\nIt is not difficult to realize that the above accomplishes the objective if we remember that there is a \"best match\" policy to determine the end result.\\nUPDATING: Prior to version 1.5, blocks were only allowed in courses (and in Moodle 1.4, in the site front page). Also, the keywords used to describe the valid course formats at the time were slightly different and had to be changed in order to allow for a more open architecture. Refer to Appendix B for more information on the changes that old blocks have to make to conform to the new standard.\\n'},\n",

If you need to execute cron for individual instances it is your own responsibility to iterate over them in the block's cron function. Example:\\nfunction cron() {\\n}\\n'my_block_name' will coincide with the name of the directory the block is stored in.\\nTIP: This also means that creating a block is a possible way to create code that can respond to cron with a reasonably low overhead.

       "    'text': 'In this final part of the guide we will briefly discuss an additional capability of Moodle\\'s block system, namely the ability to very easily create blocks that display a list of choices to the user. This list is displayed with one item per line, and an optional image (icon) next to the item. An example of such a list block is the standard Moodle \"admin\" block, which illustrates all the points discussed in this section.\\nAs we have seen so far, blocks use two properties of $this->content : \"text\" and \"footer\". The text is displayed as-is as the block content, and the footer is displayed below the content in a smaller font size. List blocks use $this->content->footer in the exact same way, but they ignore $this->content->text.\\nInstead, Moodle expects such blocks to set two other properties when the get_content() method is called: $this->content->items and $this->content->icons. $this->content->items should be a numerically indexed array containing elements that represent the HTML for each item in the list that is going to be displayed. Usually these items will be HTML anchor tags which provide links to some page. $this->content->icons should also be a numerically indexed array, with exactly as many items as $this->content->items has. Each of these items should be a fully qualified HTML <img> tag, with \"src\", \"height\", \"width\" and \"alt\" attributes. Obviously, it makes sense to keep the images small and of a uniform size.\\nIn order to tell Moodle that we want to have a list block instead of the standard text block, we need to make a small change to our block class declaration. Instead of extending class block_base , our block will extend class block_list . For example:\\n\\n\\nIn addition to making this change, we must of course also modify the get_content() method to construct the $this->content variable as discussed above:\\nfunction get_content() {\\n}\\nTo summarize, if we want to create a list block instead of a text block, we just need to change the block class declaration and the get_content() method.

You also can change the icons easily for each block individually in your raw SCSS via the change of the Font Awesome content. For all available icons please visit http://fontawesome.io/icons/ and use the Unicode value of the icon to replace the default one. The code to change the icon looks like this example change for the block \"People\": .block_people .card-block .card-title::before { content: \\'\\\\f0c0\\'\\xa0; }.\\nDark navbar\\nBy enabling this setting you can invert the default light navbar to a dark one with white links.\\n'},\n",

It has a button that jumps to C2 and another that jumps to C6.  In this simple branch, C5 has one of its jumps set to return to C1 and the same is true for C10. All other pages simply go to the next page.\\nIn this example there are two simple branches.  Here teacher realized that only a few students needed 3 pages of review.  So the teacher moved those pages to the end of the logical order. Students were given a chance in C1 to select the review and the first question is a qualifying question to determine if the student will skip the review or jump to the review.   The teacher found that most students who had trouble with the review, did not understand the material in the first two pages, so a formative question was added. All students were given the opportunity to take the review first.\\nC1, Q1 , C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C2 , C3, Q2, C4 , End of Lesson\\nFor the sake of example, we will say that C10 is the end of the first simple branch and C4 is the end of the second simple branch.\\nWhere C1 is the table of contents.

Q2 correct answers jump to C4 and other answers jump back to C2.\\nAs a best practice, C1 has a button to end the Lesson.\\nSeveral students asked for more information on this lesson topic.   The teacher added another simple branch at the end of the lesson. This new simple branch started with its own table of contents to direct the student to different areas of interest. This teacher favored using question pages to present content and found that students enjoyed  answering a brief question, where they could earn some points (custom scoring was turned on).\\nC1, Q1 , C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C2 , C3, Q2, C4 , C11 , Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, End of Lesson\\nC11 is the teacher\\'s table of content for the \"Extra information\" series of pages.

It is the reentry into this classic branch that can pose a problem.   If all the questions have been seen, the C1 unseen question jump will end the lesson for the student instead of going to the End of Branch.\\nThis is relatively straight forward.   Students enter this classic branch through a C1 jump \"Random question within a branch\". All the answers could jump to \"Random question within a branch\". Typically an answer will jump them out of the classic branch, or direct them to the start of the classic branch.\\nAs with any random page selection, it is a good idea to make sure the student has one or more ways to leave.

The special classic branch jump options will appear in every content and question page below. Each of the series might be an entire lesson.

For our example from above, we could enter the following lines into the \"Multiple choice values\" field of the question:\\n5/ I love it 4/ I like it 3/ It\\'s OK 2/ I don\\'t like it 1/ I hate it\\nThe question will then be displayed like this:\\n(5) I love it (4) I like it (3) It\\'s OK (2) I don\\'t like it (1) I hate it\\nThis would allow for an average (e.g. \"4.5 this term, up from 3.9 last term\") to be calculated.\\nHere, you ask a question which must have a number as an answer and specify the acceptable range e.g. \"How many arms would you like, if more than 2 were possible? (please specify 0-10)\" with a range of 0-10 set in the options. It helps if you specify the acceptable range in the question text.\\nThis option lets you specify a single line answer, with an input box which is a set number of characters long (you choose). You also specify the maximum number of characters you will accept, so that the answer is not too long and/or does not run over the length of the box on screen.\\n'},\n",

The teacher chooses from the dropdown the correct page to send the student to if they click on the button that will be made from this particular description. Any pages created by the teacher will have their titles appear in this dropdown, allowing them to be selected. When a student clicks on a description button, they are sent to the page defined in the Jump associated with the button.

For a discussion on the behaviour of random questions, see MDL-6340 .\\nThe grade for the randomly chosen question will be rescaled so that the maximum grade is what you have chosen as the grade for the random question.\\nYou can add one or more random questions by choosing the number and category in the question bank.

Questions may be searched and filtered by tag in the Question bank and when adding random questions, as above.\\nQuestions can be stored and retrieved from categories in the Question bank. When you make a new question, it defaults to the category with the course name. So if you make a quiz in the Senior Physics course, questions will automatically be added to \"Default for Senior Physics\". You can opt to have your quiz questions in a category of their own (\"Quizname\") or to add a sub-category.\\nTo add a sub-category, go to Administration>Quiz administration>Question bank>Categories For more information on question contexts and categories, see Question bank\\nUsers will have access to different categories according to their permissions. For example, a regular teacher might only have access to question categories in his Physics course. In contrast, his Faculty Head of Science, with permissions in all science courses, might also have access to question categories in Biology and Chemistry.\\n'},\n",

It is OK to make small changes (e.g. fix a spelling mistake or change the grade for a partially correct response), but if you make a major change (for example, deleting a choice from a multiple choice question), then you may break the existing quiz attempts. After editing questions that affect the grading, you will need to regrade the quiz.\\nNote: You can delete all student quiz attempts and then edit the quiz as if no students had attempted it. To do this, click the quiz name and then the Results link in the Administration block. This will present a list of students and their scores. Click \"Select all\" and then \"Delete selected attempts\".\\nThere are several ways to deal with \"bad\" questions in a quiz.\\nChange the grade for the bad question to 0 in the quiz. Edit the question, changing what you will accept as a correct answer, then regrading the exam. Remember when changing a question that the next time it is used, it will be as it was in the last edit. Also, regrading will only affect one quiz at a time. You can edit the question to explain the situation to the student, and then you can set the grade for the question to zero. After you make such changes, you should regrade the quiz by clicking on the Results tab and then the Regrade tab. This will change the grade for all students who have taken the quiz so far. Remember, if another quiz uses the question, your \"explanation\" will appear as part of that quiz. You can change the grade for the bad question and then move or delete the question from your question category. The question will still appear on the quiz. Some places do not like to delete any question but will move them to a \"dead\" or \"bad\" question category. When you discover a bad question in your quiz, it may affect the question bank. Remember that a final might be made up of a certain number of random questions drawn from different question categories, the same categories used in a smaller subject quiz. It can be very important to do something about bad or invalid questions in a question category when the categories are used in other places.\\n'},\n",

Moodle can extract the username from the token and then use its internal authorization mechanisms (roles, enrollments, capabilities) and user attributes (name, picture, etc.).

CAS is similar to the Shibboleth authentication mechanism, but it is vastly simpler to set up and lacks a number of broader features like federated trust and authorization infrastructure.\\nCAS essentially works by configuring a Moodle site to not do authentication itself, but to instead forward unauthenticated users to a CAS server which will then return an authentication token to the Moodle site.  Moodle can extract the username from the token and then use its internal authorization mechanisms (roles, enrollments, capabilities) and user attributes (name, picture, etc.).  The advantage is that the Moodle site never has to handle passwords and that users, once they\\'ve authenticated the first time, can move seamlessly to another web application without having to present their credentials again.\\n'},\n",

In the schedule, each week/topic is displayed with the related activities, giving their names, due dates and specified other information.  Week and topic names are taken from the custom section name, if it exists, or the first line of the section information.\\nThe CADO absorbs information from course topics, eligible activities, and from three CADO-specific text areas and one site-specific text area.   Eligible activities are forums, assignments and quizzes that have completion enabled, or any of those activities if a course does not have completion settings enabled.  Details included from these are descriptions, due dates, completion criteria, grading rubrics and user groupings.

For most Moodle sites, the default configuration should be sufficient, and it is not necessary to change the configuration. For larger Moodle sites with multiple servers, administrators may wish to use memcached, mongodb or other systems to store cache data. The cache plugin screen provides administrators with the ability to configure what cache data is stored where. Caching in Moodle is controlled by what is known as the Moodle Universal Cache. Commonly referred to as MUC.\\nThis document explains briefly what MUC is before proceeding into detail about the concepts and configuration options it offers.\\n'},\n",
       "   {'header2_name': 'The basic cache concepts in Moodle',\n",
       "    'text': 'Caching in Moodle isn\\'t as complex as it first appears. A little background knowledge will go a long way in understanding how cache configuration works.\\nLet\\'s start with cache types (sometimes referred to as mode). There are three basic types of caches in Moodle.\\nThe first is the application cache. This is by far the most commonly used cache type in code. All users share its information, and its data persists between requests. Information stored here is usually cached for one of two reasons, either it is required information for the majority of requests and saves us one or more database interactions, or it is information that is accessed less frequently but is resource intensive to generate. By default, this information is stored in an organised structure within your Moodle data directory.\\nThe second cache type is the session cache. This is just like the PHP session that you will already be familiar with; it uses the PHP session by default. You may be wondering why we have this cache type at all, but the answer is simple. MUC provides a managed means of storing and removing information that is required between requests. It offers developers a framework to use rather than having to re-invent the wheel and ensures that we have access to a controlled means of managing the cache as required. It is important to note that this isn\\'t a frequently used cache type as, by default, session cache data is stored in the PHP session, and the PHP session is stored in the database. Uses of the session cache type are limited to small datasets as we don\\'t want to bloat sessions and thus put a strain on the database.\\nThe third and final type is the request cache. Data stored in this cache type only persists for the lifetime of the request. If you\\'re a PHP developer, think of it like a managed static variable. This is by far the least used of the three cache types. Uses are often limited to information that will be accessed several times within the same request, usually by more than an area of code.\\nCached information is stored in memory by default.\\nIf you have a system with multiple front-end web servers, the application cache must be shared between the servers. In other words, you cannot use fast local storage for the application cache but must use shared storage or some other form of shared cache such as a shared memcached.\\nThe same applies to session cache unless you use a \\'sticky sessions\\' mechanism to ensure that users always access the same front-end server within a session.\\nCache backends are where data actually gets stored. These include things like the file system, PHP session, Memcached, and memory. By default, just file system, PHP session, and memory are used within Moodle. We don\\'t require that a site has access to any other systems such a Memcached. Instead, that is something you are responsible for installing and configuring yourself. When cache backends are mentioned, think of systems outside of Moodle that can store data. The MongoDB server, the Memcached server and similar \"server\" applications.\\nCache stores are a plugin type within Moodle. They facilitate connecting Moodle to the cache backends discussed above. The standard Moodle has the three defaults mentioned above as well as Memcached, MongoDB, APC user cache (APCu) and Redis .\\nYou can find other cache store plugins in the plugins database .\\nThe code for these is located within cache/stores in your Moodle directory root.\\nWithin Moodle, you can configure as many cache stores as your architecture requires. If you have several Memcached servers, for instance, you can create a cache store instance for each. By default, Moodle contains three cache store instances that get used when you\\'ve made no other configuration.\\nA file store instance is created, which gets used for all application caches. It stores its data in your moodledata directory. A session store instance is created, which gets used for all session caches. It stores its data in the PHP session, which, by default, is stored in your database. A static memory store instance is created, which gets used for all request cache types. Data exists in memory for just the lifetime of a request.\\nCaches are created in code and are used by the developer to store data they see a need to cache. Let\\'s keep this section nice and short because perhaps you are not a developer. There is one very important point you must know about. The developer does not get any say in where the data gets cached. They must specify the following information when creating a cache to use.\\nThe type of cache they require. The area of code this cache will belong to (the API, if you will). The cache\\'s name, something they make up to describe in one word what the cache stores.\\nThere are several optional requirements and settings they can specify as well, but don\\'t worry about that at this point. The important point is that they can\\'t choose which cache backend to use; they can only choose the type of cache they want from the three detailed above.\\nThis is best described in relation to roles played in an organisation.\\nThe system administrator installs the cache backends you wish to use. Memcached, XCache, APC and so on. Moodle doesn\\'t know about these; they are outside of Moodle\\'s scope and purely the responsibility of your system administrator. The Moodle administrator creates a cache store instance in Moodle for each backend the site will make use of. There can be one or more cache store instances for each backend. Some backends like Memcached have settings to create separated spaces within one backend. The developer has created caches in code and is using them to store data. He doesn\\'t know anything about how you will use your caches; he just creates a \"cache\" and tells Moodle what type it is best for. The Moodle administrator creates a mapping between a cache store instance and a cache. That mapping tells Moodle to use the backend you specify to store the data the developer wants cached.\\nIn addition to that, you can take things further still.\\nYou can map many caches to a single cache store instance. You can map multiple cache store instances to a single cache with priority (primary ... final) You can map a cache store instance to be the default store used for all caches of a specific type that don\\'t otherwise have specific mappings.\\nIf this is the first time you are reading about the Moodle Universal Cache, this probably sounds pretty complex but don\\'t worry; it will be discussed in better detail as we work through how to configure the caching in Moodle.\\n'},\n",
       "   {'header2_name': 'Advanced concepts',\n",
       "    'text': \"These concepts are things that most sites will not need to know or concern themselves about.\\nYou should only start looking here if you are looking to maximise performance on large sites running over clustered services with shared cache backends or on multi-site architecture again where information is being shared between sites.\\nThe idea of locking is nothing new; it is the process of controlling access to avoid concurrency issues.\\nMUC has a second type of plugin; a cache lock plugin used when caches require it. To date, no caches have required it. A cache by nature is volatile, and any information that is absolutely mission-critical should be a more permanent data store, likely the database.\\nNonetheless, there is a locking system that cache definitions can require within their options, and that will be applied when interacting with a cache store instance.\\nEvery bit of data that gets stored within a cache has a calculated unique key associated with it. By default, part of that key is the site identifier making any content stored in the cache specific to the site that stored it. For most sites, this is exactly what you want. However, it's beneficial to allow multiple sites or somehow linked sites to share cached data in some situations. Of course, not all caches can be shared, however some certainly can and by sharing, you can further reduce load and increase performance by maximising resource use.\\nThis is an advanced feature; if you choose to configure sharing, please do so carefully.\\nTo make use of sharing, you need to first configure identical cache store instances in the sites you want to share information, and then on each site, set the sharing for the cache to the same value.\\nFor example, if you had several Moodle sites all the same version running on a server with APC installed you could decide to map the language cache to the APC store and configure sharing for all sites running the same version. The language cache for sites on the same version is safe to share in many situations, it is used on practically every page, and APC is extremely fast. These three points may result in a nice wee performance boost for your sites. It is important to consider with the language cache that by sharing it between sites any language customisations will also be shared.\\n\"},\n",

It is something controlled by the developer. When they create a cache they can do so in two ways, the first is by creating a cache definition. This is essentially telling Moodle about the cache they\\'ve created. The second way is to create an Ad hoc cache. Developers are always encouraged to use the first method. Only caches with a definition can be mapped and further configured by the admin. Ad hoc caches will make use of default settings only. Typically Ad hoc caches are only permitted in situations where the cache is small and configuring it beyond defaults would provide no benefit to administrators. Really it\\'s like saying you the administrator doesn\\'t need to concern yourself with it.\\nFor each cache shown here you get the following information:\\nYou\\'ll also find at the bottom of this table a link title \"Rescan definitions\".

The store name is used to identify the file store instance in the configuration interface and must be unique to the site.\\nIt can be anything you want, but we would advice making it something that describes your intended use of the file store.\\nThe following properties can also be specified, customising where the file cache will be located, and how it operates.\\nThe file cache store is the default store used for application caches and by default, the moodledata directory gets used for the cache.\\nFile access can be a taxing resource in times of increased load and the following are some ideas about configuring alternative file stores in order to improve performance.\\nFirst up is there a faster file system available for use on your server. Perhaps you have an SSD installed but are not using it for your moodledata directory because space is a premium. You should consider creating a directory or small partition on your SSD and creating a file store to use that instead of your Moodle data directory.\\nNext, you\\'ve not got a faster drive available for use, but you do have plenty of free space. Something that may be worth giving a shot would be to create a small partition on the drive you\\'ve got installed that uses a performance orientated file system. Many Linux installations these days, for example, use EXT4, a nice file system but one that has overheads due to the likes of journalling. Creating a partition and using a file system that has been optimised for performance may give you that little boost you are looking for. Remember caches are designed to be volatile and choosing a file system for a cache is a different decision to choosing a file system for your server. Finally, if you\\'re ready to go to lengths and have an abundance of memory on your server you could consider creating a ramdisk/tmpfs and pointing a file store at that.\\nPurely based in memory, it is volatile exactly like the cache is, and file system performance just isn\\'t going to get much better than this. Of course, you will be limited in space and you are essentially taking that resource away from your server.\\nPlease remember with all of these ideas that they are just ideas. Whatever you choose - test, test, test, be sure of the decision you make.\\nAdd Memcached store screenshot\\nAdd Memcached store screenshot\\nAdd Memcached store screenshot\\n\\nYou must first have a Memcached server you can access and have the Memcached PHP extension installed and enabled on your server.\\nThere are two required parameters in configuring a Memcached store.\\nServers should be added one per line and each line can contain 1 to 3 properties separated by colons.\\nThe URL or IP address of the server (required) The port the server is listening on (optional) The weight to give this server (optional)\\nFor example, if you had two Memcached instances running on your server, one configured for the default port, and one configured for 11212 you would use the following: 127.0.0.1\\n127.0.0.1:11212\\nThere are also several optional parameters you can set when creating a Memcached store.\\nImportant implementation notes\\nThe Memcached extension does not provide a means of deleting a set or entries. Either a single entry is deleted, or all entries are deleted.\\nBecause of this, it is important to note that when you purge a Memcached store within Moodle it deletes ALL entries in the Memcached server. Not just those relating to Moodle. For that reason, it is highly recommended to use dedicated Memcached servers and to NOT configure any other software to use the same servers. Doing so may lead to performance depreciation and adverse effects.\\nLikewise if you want to use Memcached for caching and for sessions in Moodle it is essential to use two Memcached servers. One for sessions, and one for caching. Otherwise, a cache purge in Moodle will purge your sessions!\\nAdd MongoDB store screenshot\\nAdd MongoDB store screenshot\\nAdd MongoDB store screenshot\\n\\nMongoDB is an open source document orientated NoSQL database.

It's a complex thing. Understand your site, understand your system, and really think how users will be using it all. If you've got a small site the gains aren't likely to be significant, if you've got a large site getting this right can lead to a substantial boost in performance. When looking at cache backends really research the advantages and disadvantages of each. Keep your site in mind when thinking about them. Depending upon your site you may find that no one cache backend is going to meet the entire needs of your site and that you will benefit from having a couple of backends at your disposal. Things aren't usually as simple as installing a cache backend and then using it. Pay attention to configuration and try to optimise it for your system. Test it separately and have an understanding of its performance before telling Moodle about it. The cache allows you to shift load off the database and reduce page request processing. If for instance you have Memcached installed but your connection has not been optimised for it you may well find yourself in a losing situation before you even tell Moodle about the Memcached server. When considering your default store instances keep in mind that they must operate with data sets of varying sizes and frequency. For a large site really your best bet is to look at each cache definition and map it to a store that is best suited for the data it includes and the frequency of access. Cache definitions have been documented Cache definitions . Again when mapping store instances to caches really think about the cache you are mapping and make a decision based upon what you understand of your site and what you know about the cache. Cache definitions have been documented Cache definitions . Test your configuration. If you can stress test it even better! If you turn on performance information Moodle will also print cache access information at the bottom of the screen. You can use this to visually check the cache is being used as you expect, and it will give you an indication of where misses etc. are occurring. Keep an eye on your backend. Moodle doesn't provide a means of monitoring a cache backend and that is certainly something you should keep an eye on. Memcached for instance drops least used data when full to make room for new entries. APC, on the other hand, stops accepting data when full. Both will impact your performance if full and you're going to encounter misses. However APC when full is horrible, but it is much faster.\\nTwo links that might be useful to anyone considering testing performance on their own servers:\\nMoodle performance testing: how much more horsepower do each new versions of Moodle require?

See Tim Hunt's article on http://tjhunt.blogspot.de/2013/05/performance-testing-moodle.html In Moodle 2.6 onwards make sure you set $CFG->localcachedir to some local directory in config.php (for each node). This will speed up some of the disk caching that happens outside of MUC, such as themes, javascript, libraries etc.\\n\"},\n",

       "    'text': 'This diagram shows how the main moodle module branches into different versions over time.\\n\\nTo see all the current tags and branches that are available, use this command on any old file (such as index.php in the top moodle directory):\\nSome tagging guidelines:\\nTag and branch names should always be all upper-case. Tags and branches should ALWAYS be applied to the entire module (all of Moodle). Don\\'t tag individual files or directories. We don\\'t allow renaming of tags because people may be relying on them, so get them right the first time!\\nThe Trunk of CVS is the main development version of Moodle. In CVS it is also known as the HEAD, or default branch.\\nMoodle developers try to keep this stable as possible, but as it usually contains new code it probably has bugs and small instabilities.\\nEvery now and then we decide the product has enough features to make a release. At this time, the trunk is tagged with a MOODLE_XX_BETA tag (in case we ever want to roll back to that point) and a new branch is formed for the release, called MOODLE_XX_STABLE.\\nA Beta package is also released at this point - it\\'s for testers who don\\'t use CVS but want to test the latest features and report bugs.\\nAs soon as the stable branch MOODLE_XX_STABLE is created, development efforts will fork into two streams for a while. Some people may continue working on new features in the trunk for the next release, but most developers should be concentrating on using the current STABLE branch and fixing bugs that are found in it.\\nYou can switch your local copy of Moodle to the STABLE version using the following command in Unix from the root directory:\\nAfter that, all the commands described above will apply to that stable version. To return to the trunk version just issue:\\nOn Windows clients you should have a menu from which you can choose the branch.\\nOnce the new STABLE branch really stabilises, a release can be declared. Packages are created for distribution and the branch will be tagged (by Martin Dougiamas) with a tag named: MOODLE_XXX\\nAll bug fixes in any STABLE branch should be merged back into the trunk so that they become available in future versions of Moodle. A floating tag called MOODLE_XX_MERGED needs to be maintained to keep track of the last merge. The procedure for such a merge is as follows (I\\'m using CVS on the Unix command line but the steps are the same for any CVS client):\\nThis diagram summarises the process\\nThis diagram summarises the process\\nThis diagram summarises the process\\n\\n1. I highly recommend keeping one checked out copy of each stable branch and the trunk/head version locally to make it easier to jump between them.  Set them all up as virtual web sites on your development machine.  I use directories like /moodle/18, /moodle/19 /moodle/dev etc.\\n2. Update to the latest stable version (I\\'ll use XX in the example but it could be 18, 19 etc) for the relevant files, and do a cvs diff just to double-check exactly what you are checking in.  Note you only need to update the files/directories you are working in, but sometimes it help to update everything anyway just to do a final check on the functionality using the web.\\n3. If all looks OK, check in the fix to the stable branch.  Make sure that the commit message contains the bug tracker ID (eg MDL-1111 ) and a decent description of your thoughts on the fix.  If you don\\'t specify a message in the command line, you\\'ll be put into an editor to type one.\\n4. Go to the very latest trunk version and make sure it\\'s up-to-date.\\n5. Merge everything into your local copy of the trunk from your stable branch since the last merge.  You can use the same sequence of (4) and (5) to merge the changes into other stable branches too (to backport the fix to the previous stable versions).\\n6. Carefully watch the update logs for conflicts, and fix every file that you see with a conflict.  Afterwards, it may help to just run a diff to make sure the result is what you expected:\\n7. Check your merged local copy back into CVS trunk version\\n8. Go back to your branch version\\n9. Update the floating merge tag for the affected files (so that it matches MOODLE_XX_STABLE) so that this process can be repeated next time\\nFinally, the values for $version in all the Moodle version.php files within the stable branch should not be updated at all if possible (except the last digit if absolutely necessary). The reason is that someone updating from a very stable version to the next very stable version could miss database upgrades that happened on the trunk.\\nIn other words, if you have changes to the database schema to commit to a stable branch, please check with Martin Dougiamas, or one of the other core Moodle developers.\\nSometimes you fix something in a branch that needs to be \"backported\" to an earlier branch. This is often the case with security fixes. The procedure is exactly the same as described above, except you apply your changes backward instead of forward (to previous versions instead of HEAD). Here is a summary, using the steps described above. The scenario is that you have a fix in MOODLE_19_STABLE that needs backporting to MOODLE_18_STABLE, but NOT to HEAD (the problem you are fixing doesn\\'t exist in HEAD):\\nWhen it comes to tagging, things change a little bit. You\\'ve now got changes in 18 and 19, both of which are stable releases, so need to be tagged as MERGED. You start with 18 (assuming you are still in that directory)\\nThen, you go and do the same for 19, regardless of whether or not the changes were merged into HEAD . Of course, if the changes need to be merged into HEAD, you do that first. But if they don\\'t, you still need to tag the modified files of each stable branch once your fixes are complete and tested:\\nSituation: we did a fix on MOODLE_19_STABLE. We modified one file for this fix. This fix needs to be done on Moodle 1.8 and trunk(HEAD). All following CVS instructions will be applied on the file that we changed.\\n1. Update to the latest stable versions (HEAD included)\\n2. On your MOODLE19 branch: commit your fix\\n3. On your HEAD repository: merge the changes\\n4. If the resulting file have some conflicts, TortoiseCVS displays a red square on the file icon. Edit the file with your text editor and resolve the conflicts.\\n5. Run a diff to make sure the result is what you expected\\n6. Commit the fix\\nWe\\'ve commit MOODLE_19_STABLE and trunk. It\\'s now time to backport the change on MOODLE_18_STABLE.\\nOn your MOODLE18 branch: reproduce step 3 to 6.\\n7. On your MOODLE19 branch: update the floating merge tag for the affected file\\nOn your MOODLE18 branch: reproduce step 7 (with Tag: MOODLE_18_MERGED).\\nOccasionally, there may be a very large feature that needs to be checked in so several people can work on it, but it is too unstable to be included in the main development trunk.\\nIn these cases a short-term branch can be created to work on the feature, and then merged back into the main trunk as soon as possible. An example called MOODLE_19_WIDGET branch can be seen in the above diagram.\\nIf you need to do this for your new WIDGET feature, follow these steps:\\n1. Discuss with other developers to make sure it\\'s necessary!\\n2. Make a new tag on the trunk (for all of moodle) called MOODLE_XX_WIDGET_PRE\\n3. Create your branch called MOODLE_XX_WIDGET\\n4. Work in that branch until the feature is reasonably stable. Commit as necessary.\\n5. When ready, merge the whole branch into the trunk, fix conflicts, commit it to the trunk and then abandon the branch.\\nGood luck, be careful and have fun!\\n'},\n",

At this time, the trunk is tagged with a MOODLE_XX_BETA tag (in case we ever want to roll back to that point) and a new branch is formed for the release, called MOODLE_XX_STABLE.\\nA Beta package is also released at this point - it\\'s for testers who don\\'t use CVS but want to test the latest features and report bugs.\\nAs soon as the stable branch MOODLE_XX_STABLE is created, development efforts will fork into two streams for a while. Some people may continue working on new features in the trunk for the next release, but most developers should be concentrating on using the current STABLE branch and fixing bugs that are found in it.\\nYou can switch your local copy of Moodle to the STABLE version using the following command in Unix from the root directory:\\nAfter that, all the commands described above will apply to that stable version.

A floating tag called MOODLE_XX_MERGED needs to be maintained to keep track of the last merge. The procedure for such a merge is as follows (I\\'m using CVS on the Unix command line but the steps are the same for any CVS client):\\nThis diagram summarises the process\\nThis diagram summarises the process\\nThis diagram summarises the process\\n\\n1. I highly recommend keeping one checked out copy of each stable branch and the trunk/head version locally to make it easier to jump between them.  Set them all up as virtual web sites on your development machine.  I use directories like /moodle/18, /moodle/19 /moodle/dev etc.\\n2. Update to the latest stable version (I\\'ll use XX in the example but it could be 18, 19 etc) for the relevant files, and do a cvs diff just to double-check exactly what you are checking in.  Note you only need to update the files/directories you are working in, but sometimes it help to update everything anyway just to do a final check on the functionality using the web.\\n3. If all looks OK, check in the fix to the stable branch.  Make sure that the commit message contains the bug tracker ID (eg MDL-1111 ) and a decent description of your thoughts on the fix.  If you don\\'t specify a message in the command line, you\\'ll be put into an editor to type one.\\n4. Go to the very latest trunk version and make sure it\\'s up-to-date.\\n5. Merge everything into your local copy of the trunk from your stable branch since the last merge.  You can use the same sequence of (4) and (5) to merge the changes into other stable branches too (to backport the fix to the previous stable versions).\\n6. Carefully watch the update logs for conflicts, and fix every file that you see with a conflict.  Afterwards, it may help to just run a diff to make sure the result is what you expected:\\n7. Check your merged local copy back into CVS trunk version\\n8. Go back to your branch version\\n9. Update the floating merge tag for the affected files (so that it matches MOODLE_XX_STABLE) so that this process can be repeated next time\\nFinally, the values for $version in all the Moodle version.php files within the stable branch should not be updated at all if possible (except the last digit if absolutely necessary). The reason is that someone updating from a very stable version to the next very stable version could miss database upgrades that happened on the trunk.\\nIn other words, if you have changes to the database schema to commit to a stable branch, please check with Martin Dougiamas, or one of the other core Moodle developers.\\nSometimes you fix something in a branch that needs to be \"backported\" to an earlier branch. This is often the case with security fixes. The procedure is exactly the same as described above, except you apply your changes backward instead of forward (to previous versions instead of HEAD). Here is a summary, using the steps described above. The scenario is that you have a fix in MOODLE_19_STABLE that needs backporting to MOODLE_18_STABLE, but NOT to HEAD (the problem you are fixing doesn\\'t exist in HEAD):\\nWhen it comes to tagging, things change a little bit. You\\'ve now got changes in 18 and 19, both of which are stable releases, so need to be tagged as MERGED. You start with 18 (assuming you are still in that directory)\\nThen, you go and do the same for 19, regardless of whether or not the changes were merged into HEAD . Of course, if the changes need to be merged into HEAD, you do that first. But if they don\\'t, you still need to tag the modified files of each stable branch once your fixes are complete and tested:\\nSituation: we did a fix on MOODLE_19_STABLE. We modified one file for this fix. This fix needs to be done on Moodle 1.8 and trunk(HEAD). All following CVS instructions will be applied on the file that we changed.\\n1. Update to the latest stable versions (HEAD included)\\n2. On your MOODLE19 branch: commit your fix\\n3. On your HEAD repository: merge the changes\\n4. If the resulting file have some conflicts, TortoiseCVS displays a red square on the file icon. Edit the file with your text editor and resolve the conflicts.\\n5. Run a diff to make sure the result is what you expected\\n6. Commit the fix\\nWe\\'ve commit MOODLE_19_STABLE and trunk. It\\'s now time to backport the change on MOODLE_18_STABLE.\\nOn your MOODLE18 branch: reproduce step 3 to 6.\\n7. On your MOODLE19 branch: update the floating merge tag for the affected file\\nOn your MOODLE18 branch: reproduce step 7 (with Tag: MOODLE_18_MERGED).\\nOccasionally, there may be a very large feature that needs to be checked in so several people can work on it, but it is too unstable to be included in the main development trunk.\\nIn these cases a short-term branch can be created to work on the feature, and then merged back into the main trunk as soon as possible. An example called MOODLE_19_WIDGET branch can be seen in the above diagram.\\nIf you need to do this for your new WIDGET feature, follow these steps:\\n1. Discuss with other developers to make sure it\\'s necessary!\\n2. Make a new tag on the trunk (for all of moodle) called MOODLE_XX_WIDGET_PRE\\n3. Create your branch called MOODLE_XX_WIDGET\\n4. Work in that branch until the feature is reasonably stable. Commit as necessary.\\n5.

However, the cvs command is not installed by default in an OSX. You first need to install the Xcode Tools . You should find this on your original installation disk. Failing that it can be downloaded (a fairly hefty download) from the Apple developer web site .\\nFirst, you need to download a completely fresh copy of Moodle using your developer account. (If you only want a private copy for local development, anonymous login will work too.)\\n1. Get TortoiseCVS and install it, then reboot. TortoiseCVS works under Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, and 2003. Vista is also supported, although some people report problems with UAC. (In the latter case you might resort to SmartCVS .)\\n2.

After this first checkout, you can fetch the latest updated files from the CVS server:\\nRight-mouse-click on your Moodle folder (or any file) and select \"CVS Update\". Sit back and watch the logs scroll by. Take note of conflicts that may occur if your local code has changes that conflict with the incoming versions - you will need to edit these files and resolve the conflicts manually.\\nAfter modifying files (you will notice their icons change from green to red!), you can commit them back to the CVS server like this:\\nRight-mouse-click on your Moodle folder (or any file) and select \"CVS Commit...\". In the dialog box, type a clear description of the changes you are committing. Always include the name of any tracker issues related to what you are fixing (eg MDL-XXXX ). Click \"OK\". Your changes will be sent to the server. If you create a folder, BE CAREFUL about using the \"CVS Add\" option as it will add the folder to CVS without requiring a commit. Once added, the folder cannot be removed from CVS even though it will be pruned so long as it is empty.\\nN.B. I had enormous headaches with the above settings until I changed from ext to ssh.

(E.g. for Eclipse .)\\nHowever, be warned , we have noticed that when adding a new file to CVS using some IDEs (for example Eclipse), then by default they forcibly set the CVS substitution mode to -kk for ASCII files. In Moodle we like all ASCII files to be stored with the CVS default of -kkv, so if you use an IDE like this, please adjust its default.\\nIf you are never likely to add a new file to CVS, you don\\'t need to worry too much about the preceding paragraph. If you know something version control, you might think that -kk is better than -kkv, and in many ways you would be right. (For example it makes merging easier.)

For most Moodle sites, the default configuration should be sufficient, and it is not necessary to change the configuration. For larger Moodle sites with multiple servers, administrators may wish to use memcached, mongodb or other systems to store cache data. The cache plugin screen provides administrators with the ability to configure what cache data is stored where. Caching in Moodle is controlled by what is known as the Moodle Universal Cache. Commonly referred to as MUC.\\nThis document explains briefly what MUC is before proceeding into detail about the concepts and configuration options it offers.\\n'},\n",
       "   {'header2_name': 'The basic cache concepts in Moodle',\n",
       "    'text': 'Caching in Moodle isn\\'t as complex as it first appears. A little background knowledge will go a long way in understanding how cache configuration works.\\nLet\\'s start with cache types (sometimes referred to as mode). There are three basic types of caches in Moodle.\\nThe first is the application cache. This is by far the most commonly used cache type in code. All users share its information, and its data persists between requests. Information stored here is usually cached for one of two reasons, either it is required information for the majority of requests and saves us one or more database interactions, or it is information that is accessed less frequently but is resource intensive to generate. By default, this information is stored in an organised structure within your Moodle data directory.\\nThe second cache type is the session cache. This is just like the PHP session that you will already be familiar with; it uses the PHP session by default. You may be wondering why we have this cache type at all, but the answer is simple. MUC provides a managed means of storing and removing information that is required between requests. It offers developers a framework to use rather than having to re-invent the wheel and ensures that we have access to a controlled means of managing the cache as required. It is important to note that this isn\\'t a frequently used cache type as, by default, session cache data is stored in the PHP session, and the PHP session is stored in the database. Uses of the session cache type are limited to small datasets as we don\\'t want to bloat sessions and thus put a strain on the database.\\nThe third and final type is the request cache. Data stored in this cache type only persists for the lifetime of the request. If you\\'re a PHP developer, think of it like a managed static variable. This is by far the least used of the three cache types. Uses are often limited to information that will be accessed several times within the same request, usually by more than an area of code.\\nCached information is stored in memory by default.\\nIf you have a system with multiple front-end web servers, the application cache must be shared between the servers. In other words, you cannot use fast local storage for the application cache but must use shared storage or some other form of shared cache such as a shared memcached.\\nThe same applies to session cache unless you use a \\'sticky sessions\\' mechanism to ensure that users always access the same front-end server within a session.\\nCache backends are where data actually gets stored. These include things like the file system, PHP session, Memcached, and memory. By default, just file system, PHP session, and memory are used within Moodle. We don\\'t require that a site has access to any other systems such a Memcached. Instead, that is something you are responsible for installing and configuring yourself. When cache backends are mentioned, think of systems outside of Moodle that can store data. The MongoDB server, the Memcached server and similar \"server\" applications.\\nCache stores are a plugin type within Moodle. They facilitate connecting Moodle to the cache backends discussed above. The standard Moodle has the three defaults mentioned above as well as Memcached, MongoDB, APC user cache (APCu) and Redis .\\nYou can find other cache store plugins in the plugins database .\\nThe code for these is located within cache/stores in your Moodle directory root.\\nWithin Moodle, you can configure as many cache stores as your architecture requires. If you have several Memcached servers, for instance, you can create a cache store instance for each. By default, Moodle contains three cache store instances that get used when you\\'ve made no other configuration.\\nA file store instance is created, which gets used for all application caches. It stores its data in your moodledata directory. A session store instance is created, which gets used for all session caches. It stores its data in the PHP session, which, by default, is stored in your database. A static memory store instance is created, which gets used for all request cache types. Data exists in memory for just the lifetime of a request.\\nCaches are created in code and are used by the developer to store data they see a need to cache. Let\\'s keep this section nice and short because perhaps you are not a developer. There is one very important point you must know about. The developer does not get any say in where the data gets cached. They must specify the following information when creating a cache to use.\\nThe type of cache they require. The area of code this cache will belong to (the API, if you will). The cache\\'s name, something they make up to describe in one word what the cache stores.\\nThere are several optional requirements and settings they can specify as well, but don\\'t worry about that at this point. The important point is that they can\\'t choose which cache backend to use; they can only choose the type of cache they want from the three detailed above.\\nThis is best described in relation to roles played in an organisation.\\nThe system administrator installs the cache backends you wish to use. Memcached, XCache, APC and so on. Moodle doesn\\'t know about these; they are outside of Moodle\\'s scope and purely the responsibility of your system administrator. The Moodle administrator creates a cache store instance in Moodle for each backend the site will make use of. There can be one or more cache store instances for each backend. Some backends like Memcached have settings to create separated spaces within one backend. The developer has created caches in code and is using them to store data. He doesn\\'t know anything about how you will use your caches; he just creates a \"cache\" and tells Moodle what type it is best for. The Moodle administrator creates a mapping between a cache store instance and a cache. That mapping tells Moodle to use the backend you specify to store the data the developer wants cached.\\nIn addition to that, you can take things further still.\\nYou can map many caches to a single cache store instance. You can map multiple cache store instances to a single cache with priority (primary ... final) You can map a cache store instance to be the default store used for all caches of a specific type that don\\'t otherwise have specific mappings.\\nIf this is the first time you are reading about the Moodle Universal Cache, this probably sounds pretty complex but don\\'t worry; it will be discussed in better detail as we work through how to configure the caching in Moodle.\\n'},\n",
       "   {'header2_name': 'Advanced concepts',\n",
       "    'text': \"These concepts are things that most sites will not need to know or concern themselves about.\\nYou should only start looking here if you are looking to maximise performance on large sites running over clustered services with shared cache backends or on multi-site architecture again where information is being shared between sites.\\nThe idea of locking is nothing new; it is the process of controlling access to avoid concurrency issues.\\nMUC has a second type of plugin; a cache lock plugin used when caches require it. To date, no caches have required it. A cache by nature is volatile, and any information that is absolutely mission-critical should be a more permanent data store, likely the database.\\nNonetheless, there is a locking system that cache definitions can require within their options, and that will be applied when interacting with a cache store instance.\\nEvery bit of data that gets stored within a cache has a calculated unique key associated with it. By default, part of that key is the site identifier making any content stored in the cache specific to the site that stored it. For most sites, this is exactly what you want. However, it's beneficial to allow multiple sites or somehow linked sites to share cached data in some situations. Of course, not all caches can be shared, however some certainly can and by sharing, you can further reduce load and increase performance by maximising resource use.\\nThis is an advanced feature; if you choose to configure sharing, please do so carefully.\\nTo make use of sharing, you need to first configure identical cache store instances in the sites you want to share information, and then on each site, set the sharing for the cache to the same value.\\nFor example, if you had several Moodle sites all the same version running on a server with APC installed you could decide to map the language cache to the APC store and configure sharing for all sites running the same version. The language cache for sites on the same version is safe to share in many situations, it is used on practically every page, and APC is extremely fast. These three points may result in a nice wee performance boost for your sites. It is important to consider with the language cache that by sharing it between sites any language customisations will also be shared.\\n\"},\n",

It is something controlled by the developer. When they create a cache they can do so in two ways, the first is by creating a cache definition. This is essentially telling Moodle about the cache they\\'ve created. The second way is to create an Ad hoc cache. Developers are always encouraged to use the first method. Only caches with a definition can be mapped and further configured by the admin. Ad hoc caches will make use of default settings only. Typically Ad hoc caches are only permitted in situations where the cache is small and configuring it beyond defaults would provide no benefit to administrators. Really it\\'s like saying you the administrator doesn\\'t need to concern yourself with it.\\nFor each cache shown here you get the following information:\\nYou\\'ll also find at the bottom of this table a link title \"Rescan definitions\". Clicking this link will cause Moodle to go off an check all core components, and installed plugins looking for changes in the cache definitions.

The store name is used to identify the file store instance in the configuration interface and must be unique to the site.\\nIt can be anything you want, but we would advice making it something that describes your intended use of the file store.\\nThe following properties can also be specified, customising where the file cache will be located, and how it operates.\\nThe file cache store is the default store used for application caches and by default, the moodledata directory gets used for the cache.\\nFile access can be a taxing resource in times of increased load and the following are some ideas about configuring alternative file stores in order to improve performance.\\nFirst up is there a faster file system available for use on your server. Perhaps you have an SSD installed but are not using it for your moodledata directory because space is a premium. You should consider creating a directory or small partition on your SSD and creating a file store to use that instead of your Moodle data directory.\\nNext, you\\'ve not got a faster drive available for use, but you do have plenty of free space. Something that may be worth giving a shot would be to create a small partition on the drive you\\'ve got installed that uses a performance orientated file system. Many Linux installations these days, for example, use EXT4, a nice file system but one that has overheads due to the likes of journalling. Creating a partition and using a file system that has been optimised for performance may give you that little boost you are looking for. Remember caches are designed to be volatile and choosing a file system for a cache is a different decision to choosing a file system for your server. Finally, if you\\'re ready to go to lengths and have an abundance of memory on your server you could consider creating a ramdisk/tmpfs and pointing a file store at that.\\nPurely based in memory, it is volatile exactly like the cache is, and file system performance just isn\\'t going to get much better than this. Of course, you will be limited in space and you are essentially taking that resource away from your server.\\nPlease remember with all of these ideas that they are just ideas. Whatever you choose - test, test, test, be sure of the decision you make.\\nAdd Memcached store screenshot\\nAdd Memcached store screenshot\\nAdd Memcached store screenshot\\n\\nYou must first have a Memcached server you can access and have the Memcached PHP extension installed and enabled on your server.\\nThere are two required parameters in configuring a Memcached store.\\nServers should be added one per line and each line can contain 1 to 3 properties separated by colons.\\nThe URL or IP address of the server (required) The port the server is listening on (optional) The weight to give this server (optional)\\nFor example, if you had two Memcached instances running on your server, one configured for the default port, and one configured for 11212 you would use the following: 127.0.0.1\\n127.0.0.1:11212\\nThere are also several optional parameters you can set when creating a Memcached store.\\nImportant implementation notes\\nThe Memcached extension does not provide a means of deleting a set or entries. Either a single entry is deleted, or all entries are deleted.\\nBecause of this, it is important to note that when you purge a Memcached store within Moodle it deletes ALL entries in the Memcached server. Not just those relating to Moodle. For that reason, it is highly recommended to use dedicated Memcached servers and to NOT configure any other software to use the same servers. Doing so may lead to performance depreciation and adverse effects.\\nLikewise if you want to use Memcached for caching and for sessions in Moodle it is essential to use two Memcached servers. One for sessions, and one for caching. Otherwise, a cache purge in Moodle will purge your sessions!\\nAdd MongoDB store screenshot\\nAdd MongoDB store screenshot\\nAdd MongoDB store screenshot\\n\\nMongoDB is an open source document orientated NoSQL database.

It's a complex thing. Understand your site, understand your system, and really think how users will be using it all. If you've got a small site the gains aren't likely to be significant, if you've got a large site getting this right can lead to a substantial boost in performance. When looking at cache backends really research the advantages and disadvantages of each. Keep your site in mind when thinking about them. Depending upon your site you may find that no one cache backend is going to meet the entire needs of your site and that you will benefit from having a couple of backends at your disposal. Things aren't usually as simple as installing a cache backend and then using it. Pay attention to configuration and try to optimise it for your system. Test it separately and have an understanding of its performance before telling Moodle about it. The cache allows you to shift load off the database and reduce page request processing. If for instance you have Memcached installed but your connection has not been optimised for it you may well find yourself in a losing situation before you even tell Moodle about the Memcached server. When considering your default store instances keep in mind that they must operate with data sets of varying sizes and frequency. For a large site really your best bet is to look at each cache definition and map it to a store that is best suited for the data it includes and the frequency of access. Cache definitions have been documented Cache definitions . Again when mapping store instances to caches really think about the cache you are mapping and make a decision based upon what you understand of your site and what you know about the cache. Cache definitions have been documented Cache definitions . Test your configuration. If you can stress test it even better! If you turn on performance information Moodle will also print cache access information at the bottom of the screen. You can use this to visually check the cache is being used as you expect, and it will give you an indication of where misses etc. are occurring. Keep an eye on your backend. Moodle doesn't provide a means of monitoring a cache backend and that is certainly something you should keep an eye on. Memcached for instance drops least used data when full to make room for new entries. APC, on the other hand, stops accepting data when full. Both will impact your performance if full and you're going to encounter misses. However APC when full is horrible, but it is much faster.\\nTwo links that might be useful to anyone considering testing performance on their own servers:\\nMoodle performance testing: how much more horsepower do each new versions of Moodle require? How to load test your Moodle server using Loadstorm\\nIn Moodle 2.4 onwards with load-balanced web servers, don't use the default caching option that stores the data in moodledata on a shared network drive. Use memcached instead. See Tim Hunt's article on http://tjhunt.blogspot.de/2013/05/performance-testing-moodle.html In Moodle 2.6 onwards make sure you set $CFG->localcachedir to some local directory in config.php (for each node).

       "    'text': 'To create (or modify) a calculated question there are three pages to work through. The instructions below take you through the pages, step by step:\\nSelect the question category Any shared wildcards for this category are listed beneath. If you change category, you\\'ll need to click the \"Update the category\" button to refresh this list. There may not be any shared wildcards yet - if not, you can create them later if you wish. Give the question a descriptive name - this allows you to identify it in the question bank. Enter the question text . This should be the question you want the student to answer, and it must include all the information they need to calculate an answer. Therefore, it must contain at least one wildcard, inside curly braces. For example, if you wanted the student to sum numbers A and B, the question text might read: \"What is {A} + {B}?\" You may also include quantities computed from wildcards using the syntax \"{=...}: for example, the question \"What is {={A}+{B}} - {A}?\" with wildcard values A=4 and B=3 would display as \"What is 7 - 4?\" Select an image to display if you want to add a picture to the question. For the student, it appears immediately after the question text and before the choices. If you want more control over how the image appears, include it in the question text above, using the HTML editor. Set the default question grade (i.e. the maximum number of marks for this question). Set the Penalty factor (see Penalty factor below). Moodle 1.7+: If you wish, add general feedback. This is text that appears to the student after he/she has answered the question. Next add the formula for the answer . This formula must contain at least the wildcards that appear in the question text. See Correct answer formula syntax for further details. Choose the grade that the student will get for this question if they give this answer. This should be a percentage of the total marks available. For example, you could give 100% for a correct answer, and 50% for an answer that is nearly right. One of the answers must have a 100% grade . Determine the tolerance for error that you will accept in the answer. The tolerance and tolerance type settings combine to give a range of acceptable scores. So, if tolerance = t, correct answer = x and the difference between the user\\'s answer and the correct answer is dx, then the tolerance types are as follows: Nominal - mark correct if |dx| <= t Relative - mark correct if |dx| / x <= t Geometric - mark correct if x/(1+t) <= (x+dx) <= x*(1+t) The next 2 settings, \"Correct answer shows\" and \"Format\" determine the precision of the answer. Use these to select the number of decimal places or significant figures you want to use. Add some feedback which the student will see if they enter this answer. You can specify as many answer formulae as you like - click \"Add another answer blank\" to add more. You can also specify units for the answers. For example, if you enter a unit of \\'cm\\' here, and the accepted answer is 15, then the answers \\'15cm\\' and \\'15\\' are both accepted as correct. If you add more than one unit, you can also specify a multiplier. So, if your main answer was 5500 with unit W, you can also add the unit kW with a multiplier of 0.001. This means that the answers \\'5500\\', \\'5500W\\' or \\'5.5kW\\' would all be marked correct. Note that the accepted error is also multiplied, so an allowed error of 100W would become an error of 0.1kW. Finally (!) you can click \"Next page\" to save what you\\'ve done and move on. If you are editing an existing question, you can click \"Next page (new question)\" to create a completely new question based on an existing one.\\nNominal - mark correct if |dx| <= t Relative - mark correct if |dx| / x <= t Geometric - mark correct if x/(1+t) <= (x+dx) <= x*(1+t)\\nThe \\'penalty factor\\' only applies when the question is used in a quiz using adaptive mode - i.e. where the student is allowed multiple attempts at a question even within the same attempt at the quiz. If the penalty factor is more than 0, then the student will lose that proportion of the maximum grade upon each successive attempt. For example, if the default question grade is 10, and the penalty factor is 0.2, then each successive attempt after the first one will incur a penalty of 0.2 x 10 = 2 points.\\nAs for numerical questions it is possible to allow a margin within which all responses are accepted as correct. The \"Tolerance\" field is used for this. However, there are three different types of tolerances. These are Relative, Nominal and Geometric. If we say that the correct answer at quiz time is calculated to 200 and the tolerance is set to 0.5 then the different tolerance types work like this:\\nRelative: A tolerance interval is calculated by multiplying the correct answer with 0.5, i.e. in this case we get 100 so for this tolerance the correct response must be between 100 and 300. (200 ± 100)\\nThis is useful if the magnitude of the correct answer can differ greatly between different wildcard values.\\nNominal: This is the simplest tolerance type but not very powerful. The correct response must be between 199.5 and 200.5 (200 ± 0.5)\\nThis tolerance type can be useful if the differences between different correct answers are small.\\nGeometric: The upper limit of the tolerance interval is calculated as 200 + 0.5*200 and is the same as for the relative case. The lower limit is calculated as 200/(1 + 0.5). The correct response must then be between 133.33 and 300.\\nThis is useful for complex calculation that must have great tolerances where relative tolerances of 1 or more would be used for the upper limit but clearly not acceptable for the lower limit as it would make zero a correct answer for all cases.\\nThe field Significant Figures does only relate to how the correct answer should be presented in the review or the reports. Examples: If it is set to 3 then the correct answer 13.333 would be presented as 13.3; 1236 would be presented as 1240; 23 would be presented as 23.0 etc.\\nEach wildcard that you specify in the answer formula must have an associated set of possible values - this is its dataset . Each of the wildcards is listed on this page along with a choice of dataset:\\nprivate i.e. only used by this question shared i.e. shared with other calculated questions in the same category\\nUsing a shared dataset can save time when you are creating a lot of similar calculated questions.\\nNote that even when creating a question for the first time, this page may say that your wildcard \"will use the same existing private dataset as before.\" This just means that Moodle has already tentatively created a private data set for that wildcard: if a private dataset is what you want, leave this choice selected.\\nIf there is anything in the question text that looks like a wildcard, but does not appear in any of the answer formulae, you can specify whether or not this is meant to be a wildcard. If it is, you can choose whether it should use a private or shared dataset.\\nTo continue, simply choose your preferred dataset for each wildcard, then click \"Next Page\".\\nNow we need to create the set of possible values that each wildcard can take. Warning - this page is a bit confusing!\\nThere are two ways of creating values - you can type them in yourself and add them to the list, or you can have Moodle generate them for you.\\nAdding individual values to the list is easy:\\nIn the \\'Param\\' field for each wildcard, enter the value you want Scroll down to the \\'Add\\' section and click the Add button (leaving the number of items set to 1) Repeat the above steps as many times as necessary (the maximum number of items is 100)\\nTo delete values from the list:\\nIn the \\'Delete\\' section, select the number of items to delete Click the Delete button\\nStart with the \"Range of Values\" fields, and enter the lower and upper limits for the values you would accept Choose a number of decimal places for the value Choose the distribution of values between the limits - \\'uniform\\' means any value between the limits is equally likely to be generated; \\'loguniform\\' means that values towards the lower limit are more likely. Now move down to the \\'Add\\' section and click on \"force regeneration\" In the menu next to the Add button, choose the number of sets of random values (items) you wish to add to the list. (Note that the maximum total number of items in your list is 100.) Finally, click Add to append the new values to the list Note: If you want more control over the items that Moodle adds, you can do them one at a time and preview the values before you add them. Click the \"Get New Item to Add\" button to make Moodle generate new values in the \"Item to Add\" section at the top. If you like them, click \"Add\" for 1 item; if not, click \"Get New Item to Add\" again to get new values.\\nOnce your list of items (values) is complete, you are finished. It\\'s up to you how many values you add - the more values you add, the more a question can be used by the students without them seeing the same values repeatedly.\\nNote that if you delete values from the list, you can put them back again. Change the \"Next Item to Add\" option to \"reuse previous value if available\", then the next time you add items, Moodle will restore your previously deleted items from the dataset.\\nOnce your list of values is complete, you can click \\'Save changes\\' to finish.\\nWarning: This button can affect several questions, so be careful before using it.\\nAssume you have selected dataset parameter for {a} to be any value between 1-10 and generated a question. In the second question also you decide to use a SHARED wildcard called {a}. Inherently, it will show a value between 1-10. However, your need here changes and you want to make it 11-100 instead. Then, you change them in the range and click this button. Voila! the values change and you can add new items here using the \\'Get New item to add\\'. However, if you go back to your previous question, you will see that values would change there too, because it is a shared dataset. If you do not update parameters, then this may not happen and will generate a new set of values and displays them in the \"Item to Add\" section.\\n'},\n",

       "    'text': 'In the recent versions of the calculated question type, you could have more than one answer formula and applied a specific grading value to each of them as long as there is at least one 100% correct answer formula.\\n\\nAs a general rule, write these formulas like you would in a calculator e.g. 3 + 5 * sin(3/{x}) A notable exception is exponentiation, where x 3 cannot be entered as {x}^3 , but instead should be entered as pow({x}, 3) . Each function\\'s placeholders and other arguments should be in parentheses (brackets). For example, if you want students to calculate the sine of one angle and cosine of two times another angle, you would enter sin({a}) + cos({b}*2) or sin({a}) + cos(2*{b}) . It\\'s usually better to have too many parentheses (brackets) than too few.  The server won\\'t care, and the more specific you are about what you mean, the more likely it will like your complex formulas. There is no implicit multiplication.  To you, the human editor, \"5(23)\" or \"5x\" may seem perfectly obvious.  To the server doing the math, it\\'s crazy talk and won\\'t be understood.  Always use the \"*\" for multiplication. Any special mathematical function must have parentheses around its values.  Take the sine function in the first bullet point for instance.  Notice that the 3 / x is wrapped in parentheses (brackets)--this is so the server can understand it properly.  Without those parentheses, the server won\\'t know if you mean \"(sin 3) / x\" or \"sin (3 / x)\" and will reject the entire formula accordingly.\\n'},\n",

The default teacher role does have this capability, but if you believe it leads to problems in your installation, you can revoke it.\\nGiven \"mod/scheduler:seeoverviewoutsideactivity\", teachers always see their own bookings in any scope. However, for seeing other teachers\\' bookings they would need the following additional permissions:\\n\"In this scheduler\": #mod/scheduler:canseeotherteachersbooking at the level of the present scheduler \"In this course\": mod/scheduler:canseeotherteachersbooking at the level of the present course \"Anywhere\": mod/scheduler:canseeotherteachersbooking at site level\\nIn typical setups, this means that a teacher can see all bookings in the current course, whereas a site admin would see all bookings at site level.\\nEdit grades in appointments of any teacher, using the appointment screen. (Note that users with the #mod/scheduler:manageallappointments capability can edit all grades as well.)\\nEdit all appointment-related notes in appointments of any teacher, using the appointment screen. (Note that users with the #mod/scheduler:manageallappointments capability can edit all notes as well.)\\nMark or unmark students as attended in appointments of any teacher, using the checkboxes in the \" All appointments \" screen or in individual appointment screens. (Note that users with the #mod/scheduler:manageallappointments capability can mark/unmark students as attended as well.)\\n'}]},\n",
